<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="small center mb2"><i>Preparations for Reception.—Reception by
Grand Pawnees.</i></p>

<p>During the evening previous to our
arrival, several half-breeds, who had been
sent out by the Commissioner to gain information
of the probable reception which
awaited us, came dropping in, all bearing
promises of a friendly welcome, from
the Pawnee chiefs. At sunrise the next
morning, the tents were struck, and
placed in the heavy baggage wagons; and
a more than usual bustle and note of preparation
was heard in the camp. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
soldiers seated themselves upon the grass,
to examine and prepare their arms; and
the Otoe Indians, were busily engaged
in ornamenting themselves for the meeting.
Some had spread their blankets upon the
prairie, and were anxiously employed
in tracing various figures in vermilion,
upon their woolly surfaces. Some,
eagerly bending over the small pools
of still water left in the dry bed of the
river, were painting their faces with
vermilion, manifesting as much interest
and anxiety in the choice of their ornaments,
as a young belle preparing for her
first ball. Paint was placed on and rubbed
off. Faces were striped first in one
direction, then in another; and the advice
of those who were sitting round,
was asked and given, with all the gravity
befitting so important an operation. In
the meantime, two or three finished
their toilets, and seated themselves at a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
short distance to serve as models for the
rest. Several who had acquired some
reputation for skill in this art, were busily
engaged in painting up the less gifted of
their companions. Whilst this was going
on in one quarter, in another, five or six
Indians, who either had no paint, or cared
not about the opinion of those they intended
to visit, lay stretched at full length in
the grass. Here they kept up an incessant
drumming upon their breasts
with their fists, in exact time to a chant,
which they were letting out at the top of
their lungs, and which always wound up
with a loud yell, by way of chorus.</p>

<p>But there must be an end of all things,
and in due time there was an end of the
preparations. The tents were packed;
the Indians were painted and striped to
resemble any thing but men; the soldiers
had adjusted their arms; the horses were
saddled; the oxen were secured before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
the heavy baggage wagons, and the party
commenced slowly moving towards the
village.</p>

<p>It was a fine sunny morning; the clumps
of trees which clustered on the low banks
of the river, and the numberless islands
which dotted its broad, shallow waters,
were alive with woodpeckers of every
size and hue. In every direction, they
darted among the tall dead trees which
overhung the muddy stream, making the
trunks resound with the incessant hammering
of their small but powerful beaks.
Large flocks of gaily plumed parroquets,
whirled screaming past us, with a surprising
velocity.</p>

<p>At ten o’clock the party had travelled
several miles across the prairie, and our
vicinity to the village was becoming
more perceptible. Mounted Indians, sent
out to watch for our approach, were
seen here and there flying across the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
hills in the direction of the village, to give
notice of the arrival to their chiefs. At a
distance we could perceive several bands
of Indians in pursuit of large droves of
their wild and fiery horses, which they
were urging at a headlong speed in the
direction of the town. In another quarter,
on the top of a ridge of small hills,
groups of five or six were standing, intently
watching the motions of the party,
which, from the jaded state of the oxen,
were necessarily slow. The soldiers who
had been lazily lounging across the prairie,
were now called in, and formed in a compact
body round the baggage wagons.
An hour more brought us in sight of the
village.</p>

<p>Upon our near approach, we could
perceive that the hills surrounding it were
black with masses of mounted warriors.
Though they swarmed upon their tops,
to the number of several thousands, yet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
they stood motionless and in silence, watching
the approach of the mission. At length
a single horseman detached himself from
the mass, and came galloping down the hill
and over the prairie to meet us. As he approached
there was a wild, free air about
him, and he governed his gigantic black
horse with the greatest ease. I could not
but think that if the rest of these warriors
were of the same mould, any resistance of
our band, however desperate, would avail
but little against an attack of these proud
rulers of the prairie.</p>

<p>Upon reaching the party, he sprang
from his horse, and shook hands with
Mr. E——. He then gave directions
through the interpreter, that the band
should be drawn up in as small a compass
as possible, to avoid all contact with his
warriors. After spending some time in
completing his arrangements, he galloped
back, and gave the signal to the rest.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
In an instant the hills were deserted, and
the whole mass of warriors were rushing
towards us, across the broad bosom of the
prairie. It was a moment of intense and
fearful expectation. On they came; each
mad horse, with erect mane and blazing
eye, urged forward by the bloody spur of
an Indian master. They had reached
within two hundred yards of the party,
but still the speed of their horses was unchecked,
and the powerful tramp of their
hoofs rang like thunder upon the sod of the
prairie. At a signal, however, from the
chief, the band separated to the right and
left, and commenced circling round us, in
one dark, dense flood. Their whoops and
yells, and the furious and menacing
manner in which they brandished their
bows and tomahawks, would have led
a person unacquainted with their habits,
to have looked upon this reception
as any thing but friendly. There is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
something in the fierce, shrill scream
of a band of Indian warriors, which rings
through the brain, and sends the blood
curdling back to the heart. Their ornaments,
though wild, were many of them
beautiful. The closely shaved heads of
some were adorned with the plumage of
different birds. Others wore an ornament
of deer’s hair, bound up in a form resembling
the crest of an ancient helmet, and a
plume of the bald eagle floated from the
long scalp-locks of the principal warriors.</p>

<p>Some few wore necklaces of the claws
of the grisly bear, hanging down upon
their breasts. The bodies of some were
wrapped in buffalo robes, or the skin of
the white wolf; but the most of them wore
no covering, save a thick coat of paint.
This they had profusely smeared over
their bodies and arms, and many had
even bestowed it upon the heads and
limbs of their horses. After dashing round<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
us for some time, the chief waved his
hand, and the turmoil ceased. The warriors
sprang from their horses, and seating
themselves round in a large circle, waited
for the arrival of the chief of the Grand
Pawnees. In a few moments he advanced
to meet Mr. E——, accompanied by the
different chiefs of Tappaye Pawnee, Pawnee
Republican, and Pawnee Loup villages.
He was a tall, powerful Indian.
A fillet of the skin of the grisly bear, ornamented
with feathers, was bound round
his head. Over his shoulder was thrown
a large mantle of white wolf-skin, also
adorned with feathers. His legs were
cased in black leggings of dressed buffalo
hide, worked with beads, and fringed
with long locks of human hair. These
were taken from scalps won in his various
war expeditions, and hung down over
his knees, trailing upon the ground as
he walked. He first advanced and welcomed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
Mr. E——, and afterwards the
rest. The chiefs of the three different villages
were then introduced, and repeated
the words of welcome uttered by the first.</p>

<p>This ceremony was scarcely finished,
when a movement was observed among the
crowd, and a powerful roan horse, mounted
by an armed Indian, bounded forward
to the middle of the circle, where the rider
sprang from his back. He was a stranger
among the tribe, and spoke not their language—a
Kioway<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> Indian, from the borders
of Mexico—a member of those wild
tribes, who like the Arabs rove the immense
plains of the west, and carry destruction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
to all who are not strong enough to
resist them. After pausing and looking
around him for a moment, with a
glance that seemed to challenge opposition
from the assembled warriors, he walked
up to Mr. E——. He was slight and
beautifully formed; but there was a fire
in his eye; a swell of the nostril; and a
proud curve of the lip, which showed a
spirit that brooked no opposition; shunned
no danger; and could only be quenched
by the chill of the grave. His long black
hair, which trailed behind him on the
ground, was plaited together, and ornamented
with about twenty plates of massive
silver. A band of silver was fastened
round his throat, and several large medals
of the same metal hung upon his breast.
Upon his arms were several bands of silver,
and rings of the same upon his
fingers. His leggings, though more finely
wrought, like those of the chiefs,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
were fringed with scalps. A scalp consisting
of the entire upper part of a human
head, hung from the bit of his fiery
horse. Upon coming up he offered his
hand to Mr. E——, and in succession to
the rest; and after pausing and gazing
upon us for a short time, with some curiosity,
he sprang upon his horse, and riding
through the circle, was lost behind the
more distant crowd of warriors.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[A]</a> We afterwards learned that this Indian had become
enamoured of a young girl of his own tribe,
the wife of another; but her husband having gone
upon some expedition, she had taken advantage of
his absence to leave her nation with her lover; and
together they had fled to the Pawnee village, which
they reached a week previous to our arrival.</p>

</div>

<p>For a short time after the introduction
of the various chiefs, the mass of grim
beings hemmed us in, sitting upon the
ground like so many dark forms of
statuary, without voice or motion. Several
at length arose, and coming towards
Mr. E——, and Major D——, (the
United States agent for the Pawnee Indians,)
extended the stem of their pipes
to the lips of each, then, instantly retiring,
resumed their station in the crowd. By
this action, we afterwards learned, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
each pledged himself to present a horse
to the person to whom he extended his
pipe. In the meanwhile, two old men,
who had no horses to lose by the free indulgence
of liberal feelings, rose up, and
by loud and vehement harangues, endeavoured
to pique the liberality of the rest.
They boasted of the number they would
bestow, <i>if they but had them</i>, and recounted
as examples the acts of generosity
which they had performed in their youth.
As that youth ran far back, beyond the
memory of the oldest inhabitant, there was
little probability of their being contradicted.</p>

<p>After they had finished, the Wild
Horse, (I do not recollect his Indian
name) the principal warrior of the nation,
stood up and harangued the assembled
multitude. He launched out in a long
panegyric upon the whites, which was
delivered with a warmth of expression no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
doubt greatly increased by the sight of
the wagons laden with presents. This
warrior was one of the most singular as
well as ferocious of the tribe; and many
were the tales of his war expeditions,
afterwards related to us by the trappers,
as we lay stretched around our night-fires.
His height could have been but little short
of seven feet, and every limb was in proportion.
Unlike the rest of his tribe, his
hair remained unshaven, and hung in long
tangled locks, which reached nearly to his
waist, and were profusely smeared with
red ochre. His low, retreating forehead
was almost buried in wrinkles; and his
eyes, deep set in his head, glowed like
living coals. His nose was large and prominent;
and the size of an enormous mouth
was not at all diminished by two streaks of
vermilion, which he had drawn from each
corner, to his ears. He wore neither covering
nor ornament, unless the profusion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
of black clay and red ochre which covered
his body, deserved that name. He
stood out in his naked proportions a giant
among those who surrounded him; and
the wild energy of his gesticulation as he
delivered his harangue, showed the prodigious
strength hidden in his form, and
which only required an occasion to bring
it into action. From his youth upward
he had been the leading warrior in the
nation, and his deeds had spread a terror
of his name through all the hostile tribes.
Though no chief, his influence in the village
was equal to theirs, rendering him as
much an object of jealousy to them as of
dread to their enemies.</p>

<p>When he had finished his address, the
chief rose and spoke to his men. After
this the circle opened, and forming into
two lines, one on each side, the warriors
prepared to escort us into their village.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

</div>

<p class="small center mb2"><i>Journey to the Grand Pawnee Village.—Old
Indian Female.—Chief’s Lodge.—Indian
Feasts.—Kioway Female.</i></p>

<p>As soon as we emerged from the crowd
that had surrounded us, we perceived the
plain between us and the village swarming
with the rest of its inhabitants. It appeared
as if every man, woman, and child
had looked upon the day of our arrival, as
one of jubilee. The boys had thrown aside
their bows and arrows, the females had
abandoned their drudgery, and the old men
had ceased their songs of former victories,
to paint themselves up for the festival.
The reception was over, and all the requisite
awe of their nation had been impressed
upon us. They now threw aside<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
the stern, unbending character of the Indian
warrior, and pressed round us with
all the kind hospitality of hosts, in receiving
their most welcome guests.</p>

<p>Small bands of young men amused themselves
by dashing around the party, at the
full speed of their horses, and attempting
to oust each other from their saddles by
the violent collision of their animals. Occasionally
a few would start off in a race
across the plain, whooping and screaming,
and clattering their arms in the ears of
their steeds, to excite them even beyond
the mad rate at which they were careering.</p>

<p>Others of the young men hung round
the party, making their remarks on its
different members, and occasionally exciting
loud peals of laughter from their
comrades. These however were frequently
cut short by a stern word from one of
the chiefs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<p>The whole road from the plain to the
village, was lined with women and children.
They had not dared to approach
during the formalities of our reception,
but now eagerly pressed forward to gaze
upon so unwonted a sight as that of a
white stranger entering freely into their
village. Besides this they were all anxious
to gratify that curiosity which is peculiarly
strong in the bosom of an Indian—especially
a female.</p>

<p>They were nearly all mounted upon
little stiff-maned drudge horses of the village,
sometimes singly, but generally in
clusters of two or three.</p>

<p>In particular, one withered, gray-headed
old squaw, with a family of four children
under her charge, attracted our attention.
She was mounted upon a little
wall-eyed, cream-coloured pony, with a
roach mane and a bob-tail. There was a
lurking devil looking out of his half-closed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
eye, the very antipodes of his rider, who
sat upon his back like the picture of
Patience. Her charge she had arranged,
as well as could be expected from a person
in her situation. One little fellow,
whose eyes gleamed like sparks of fire,
from beneath the long tangled hair, which
nearly covered his face, was striding almost
upon the neck of the horse, armed
with a heavy Indian whip. One little one
was dozing in her arms, another was clinging
tightly to her back. The face of a
fourth, like the head of a caterpillar, just
ready to emerge from a cocoon, was peering
from the mouth of a leather bag, fastened
between her shoulders.</p>

<p>But though the woman thus scrupulously
divided the burden with her steed, he
seemed far from satisfied with his situation,
and at last determined to rid himself of his
encumbrance.</p>

<p>Tossing his head in the air, he commenced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
waltzing, and capering round upon
his hind feet, to the great discomfiture of
the squaw. In great tribulation she reached
out both hands, and clung with might
and main to the high pommel of the Indian
pack-saddle, while two of the children,
left to their own guidance, clung
like monkeys round her body.</p>

<p>The horse, finding that the first experiment
had not succeeded to his satisfaction,
altered his plan of action. He planted
his fore feet firmly upon the sod, and
flourished his heels as high in the air as
his head was the moment before. Still
his rider continued to cling to the saddle,
making use of every expression of Indian
objurgation and soothing, in a vain appeal
to the sensibilities of the restive animal.
There was one, however, evidently delighted
with his capers; this was the naked
little elf perched upon his neck, who
evidently aided and abetted the mutiny by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
a sudden switch of his whip—occasionally
casting back his sly, laughing black eye
upon the chattering old lady and her
screaming brood.</p>

<p>At last the animal finding that no physical
force of his could free his back from
the burden, came to the conclusion that
the less time he spent in accomplishing his
journey the shorter would be his ordeal.
So he started off at a full gallop for the
village, and we caught our last glimpse of
him as he dashed between the lodges,
urged on by the lash of his imp-like little
rider.</p>

<p>When the party had once commenced its
march, it was not long before they reached
the point of destination; for though the
Indians crowded forward to satisfy their
curiosity, they remained at such a distance
as to offer no obstacle to our progress.
This rule of etiquette was, however,
occasionally transgressed by troops<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
of untrimmed, goblin-looking little urchins
who hung upon the heels of the party.
They crowded around the baggage wagons,
and gazed with a mixture of terror
and wild delight upon the oxen, who,
with lolling tongues and reeling steps,
were, almost inch by inch, winning their
way to the village.</p>

<p>Several times when a circle of little
curious faces, anxious to see, but ready to
run, had formed around the team, a sharp,
shrill scream from some more mischievous
of the gang, would in an instant disperse
all their rallied courage, and send them
scampering at full speed over the prairie.</p>

<p>Another grand object of attraction was
<i>the Black Bear</i>, who trudged in front,
surrounded by a rabble crowd of women
and children. From the first moment of
our arrival he had been an object of intense
curiosity, and had been gazed at
with a mixture of fear and astonishment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
by the whole nation. But there is an old
saying that “too much familiarity breeds
contempt;” and in this case it was verified.
By degrees, the circle which formed
around him at a respectful distance,
became more and more compressed. It
was in vain that he attempted to rid
himself of their company; they swarmed
around him like ants. If he quickened
his pace, they did the same; if he lingered,
they were equally slow; and if he
turned upon them, they scattered in every
direction. But after a while, even this
wore off, and they finally hemmed him in,
so that it was almost impossible to move for
the crowd. When they had thus closed
upon him, the lurking spirit of mischief
began to show itself. They tugged at his
coat tail, they pulled his pantaloons, and
they jostled him until the perspiration,
the effect of fear and exertion, poured in
streams down his face. At length one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
toothless, gray-headed old crone, attracted
by the glistening appearance of his
black leather cap, made a violent snatch,
and seized hold of it. A hot scramble ensued
for the prize, which, after much derangement
to the wardrobe of the negro,
was obtained by the rightful owner. He
had no sooner regained his property, than
he opened his shirt, and placed it next his
bosom. He then buttoned his coat over
it up to the chin, evincing his respect to
the nation by performing the rest of his
journey <i>uncovered</i>.</p>

<p>We found that the Pawnee village had
been rebuilt since it was burnt by the Delawares.
It is situate in the open prairie,
at the foot of a long range of hills, and
within about fifty yards of the Platte.
The river at this place is about two
miles broad, and very shallow, being constantly
forded by the squaws, who visit
the different islands, and obtain from them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
the only fuel and building materials, to be
found in this part of the country.</p>

<p>The lodges are numerous, and stand
close together, without the least regard to
regularity. They are built in the same
way as those in the Otoe village.</p>

<p>On account of the scarcity of wood,
several families congregate together in the
same lodge. The male portion pass the
whole day, lounging and sleeping around,
or gorging themselves from the large kettle
filled with buffalo flesh, which is perpetually
over the fire.</p>

<p>As we entered the village, the tops of
the lodges were completely covered with
women and children, and the area in front
of the chief’s dwelling was equally crowded.
When we reached the front, the
chief, who had ridden in advance of the
party, stepped from the dark passage
which formed the entrance to his abode,
to meet us. He was completely enveloped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
in a robe of white wolf skin, upon which
was painted a hieroglyphic account of his
warlike achievements. Upon the approach
of Mr. E——, he advanced towards him,
and taking the robe from his shoulders, presented
it to him, requesting him (through
the interpreter) to keep it for his sake.
He then ushered the party into his dwelling,
and pointed out the place allotted for
the reception of the contents of the wagons.
After this he called together a number
of Indians, and gave them directions
to assist in unloading. He stood at the
door, watching their movements, to prevent
any attempt at purloining—a crime
too common among the lower classes of an
Indian village.</p>

<p>Nearly half an hour elapsed in this
way, during which time the lodge was becoming
more and more crowded. One
dusky form after another glided with a
noiseless step over the threshold, moving<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
across to the darkest corners of the lodge.
Here they seated themselves upon the
ground, and shrouded their shaggy robes
around them, so as completely to screen
the lower part of their faces. As they
fixed their unwavering gaze upon us
from the dark parts of the building their
eyes seemed to shine out like glowing balls
of phosphorus.</p>

<p>Not a word was spoken—no undertoned
conversation was carried on—all was
silence, save the hurried footsteps of those
who were busied according to the directions
of the chief. No jests were uttered,
for we were now under the roof of their
leader, and any word spoken in derogation
of his guests would have called down instant
punishment.</p>

<p>Upon our entrance into the lodge, a
large kettle had been filled with buffalo
flesh and hard corn, and placed over the
fire. When we were fairly settled in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
our abode, and the bustle of unloading
had in a measure passed away, the wife
of the chief (by-the-by he had five of
them) poured the whole of its contents
into a large wooden bowl. She then armed
each of us with a black dipper made
of buffalo horn, and made signs for us to
commence.</p>

<p>We did not wait for a second invitation,
but immediately, with both fingers
and dippers, attacked the mountain
of food before us. We had not eaten
since daylight; it was now late in the
day; and the appetites of the party, never
particularly delicate, having increased in
proportion to the length of their fast, the
devastation was enormous. But every excess
brings with it its own punishment;
and our case was not an exception to
the general rule. Scarce had we finished,
when a little Indian boy, half covered
with a tattered buffalo skin, forced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
his way into the lodge, elbowing in among
the warriors with all that transient air
of consequence worn by <i>little</i> characters
when charged with some mission of importance.
He came to the side of the chief,
who was sitting near us, with his legs
doubled under him, after the Turkish
fashion, and whispered in his ear. The
chief rose, and announced that the Long
Hair, the second warrior of the village,
had prepared a feast in honour of our arrival,
and was waiting for us to come and partake.
There was some demurring as to the
acceptance of this invitation. The Interpreter,
however, informed us that there
was no resource, as eating your way into
the good will of the savages, is necessary
to the success of an Indian treaty. It was
useless to plead that we had already eaten
sufficient, for that is a thing incredible to
an Indian, who always carries with him
an appetite proportioned to the quantity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
to be eaten, and the opportunity of
doing so. Let the latter come as often
as it may, it invariably finds him prepared.</p>

<p>After some consultation, seeing no remedy,
we left the lodge, and followed
our little guide through the intricacies of
the village, to the dwelling of the Long
Hair. When we entered he was sitting
upon the ground, and motioned us to a
seat upon some dirty cushions of undressed
hides. He was a stern, gloomy
looking man, with an anxious, wrinkled
brow, a mouth like iron, and an eye like
fire. He evidently made efforts to be sociable;
but it was not in his nature; and
during the whole feast, the stern, unbending
character of the Indian warrior, was
continually peering out from beneath the
show of hospitality. He urged us to eat,
and he even attempted to smile; but it
more resembled the angry snarl of a wild-cat,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
than the evidence of any pleasurable
emotion. In short, we liked him not, and
hurried through our feast as soon as possible.
When we had finished, and while a
number of the party were smoking, in
turn, from a large red stone pipe, which
he passed round, the Doctor rose and slowly
sauntered round the lodge. He at length
observed a small bundle of bones, and skin,
which hung from a pole crossing the centre
of the lodge. Curious to know what
it might contain, he reached out his hand
to take hold of it. From the moment
that he had left his seat, the brow of the
chief had darkened, but he said nothing;
contenting himself by narrowly watching
the motions of his guest;—but no sooner
had he touched the bundle, than the effect
upon the frame of the Indian was like an
electric shock. He half started from his
seat; the veins on his forehead swelled
like whipcord; and his eyes shot fire.—With<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
clenched fists and extended arms,
he shrieked out something between a
yell and an imprecation. The secret
was soon explained by the frightened Interpreter.
The bundle that had attracted
the curiosity of the Doctor, was the medicine
bag<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> of the lodge. To disturb this
is one of the greatest outrages that can be
inflicted upon the superstitious feelings of
an Indian. At another time, the Doctor
might have paid dearly for his rashness.
As it was, at the earnest solicitations of
the Interpreter, he resumed his seat, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
the anger of the chief passed away.
Shortly after this, another courier arrived
to invite us to a third feast; and taking
our leave, we followed him. This feast
was exactly the same as the former. Before
we had finished, invitation after invitation
came pouring in upon us, until we
had visited about ten or fifteen lodges.
One after another, the different members
of the party then gave out, and returned to
the abode of the chief.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[B]</a> Every lodge in an Indian village contains what
is called its Medicine Bag, which is hung up in the
most conspicuous place, and regarded with the greatest
veneration, not only by the inhabitants of that
individual lodge, but by the whole tribe. Little is
known of their contents, as they are seldom opened,
and always with the greatest formalities. On these
occasions, all possible care is taken to exclude strangers,
whose presence or interference is regarded as a
certain source of future misfortune.</p>

</div>

<p>Upon our return, Mr. E—— assembled
the different warriors, and after some consultation,
the following day was appointed
for holding a council, to agree upon the
terms of the treaty.</p>

<p>When this was settled, the chief turned
and spoke a few words to the heralds.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
They immediately started through the village,
proclaiming the time appointed for
the council.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[C]</a> These heralds are self-elected, and are composed
of the oldest men in the village, who run
through the town to spread the orders of the chief.
When no such service is required, they amuse themselves
by stalking round the village, yelling out advice
to the young men, with voices which may be
heard at the distance of a mile, but which, as far as
I was able to judge, was but little attended to.</p>

</div>

<p>While Mr. E—— was thus engaged, the
rest of the party drew round the fire, to discuss
the different events of the day. The
bear-skin, forming the inner door of the
lodge, was slowly raised, and a female stepped
timidly in, and moved rapidly, and evidently
with a desire to escape observation,
into the darkest part of the lodge. Her
whole appearance bespoke her a stranger.
She was beautiful; and though a timid being,
moved with the step of a queen. She
was the wife of the Kioway Indian, and
her dress was of a richness corresponding
with his. A bright band of silver was
fastened round her neck; a small jacket<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
of scarlet cloth, the spoil of some pillaged
caravan, edged with silver lace and beads,
was secured round her waist and breast,
with scarlet ribands, and a long garment
of blue cloth enveloped the rest of her
form. Like her husband, she wore medals
of silver upon her breast, and bracelets of
the same upon her wrists. Her mocassins,
also, were more finely ornamented than
those of the Pawnee women, who were
seated around.</p>

<p>From the moment of her entrance, she
became the object of attraction to all eyes.
Observing this, she withdrew into one of
the berths, and dropping in front of her a
screen of grass matting, remained there
for the rest of the day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

</div>

<p class="small center mb2"><i>Grand Pawnee Village.—The Council.</i></p>

<p>The second day after our arrival was
appointed for holding the council. It was
a fine frosty morning. The sun rose like
a huge ball of crimson over the low hills;
pouring a flood of lurid light upon the
dancing waters of the Platte, and gemming
with a thousand tints, the frost beads that
glittered upon the tall withering grass of
the prairie.</p>

<p>A number of us left the lodge early in
the morning, and strolled towards the
banks of the Platte. A few gaunt, sinewy
wolf-dogs were prowling about the silent
village, in search of food. The savages
had not yet left their lairs, except one or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
two solitary individuals, muffled in their
robes, who at sight of us, hurried to their
abodes to give information that the strangers
were stirring. Occasionally, as we
passed the dark funnel-like mouth of the
dwellings, the half of a face would be seen,
cautiously looking out, and after staring
at us for an instant, would vanish into the
interior to call out the rest of the inhabitants.</p>

<p>We had not proceeded far, before about
a dozen half-starved Indian wolf-dogs collected
at our heels. Here they followed,
raising their nostrils, baring their long
white fangs, and uttering deep growls.
Their green flashing eyes; their long
bristling hair; and their tails stiffly extended
as they slowly stalked after us,
convinced us that they waited only for the
slightest appearance of fear on our part,
to commence an attack. It also plainly
showed that however welcome our appearance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
might be to the Indians, there were
some members of the village who did not
participate in the general feeling of joy.</p>

<p>In spite, however, of this show of ill
will, we continued our walk until we
reached the Platte. Here we seated ourselves
upon the trunk of a tree lying prostrate
on the bank of the river.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the Indians had received
intelligence of our movements, and
began to edge towards the stream. The
children came running openly and in
droves. The old men and warriors carelessly
sauntered along towards the water,
and came down upon us as if by accident.
Others more modest, crouched
down in the long grass, creeping stealthily
forward, until every stump concealed a
painted form, and every bush was alive
with curious faces.</p>

<p>Nearest to us was a tall, thin Indian,
clad in an old, worn-out buffalo-robe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span></p>

<p>There was a “gallows-bird” look about
him,—no doubt some prodigal son, disinherited
by a crusty old curmudgeon father.
He was standing with his back half
towards us, and his face turned away,
apparently gazing up the river; the very
attitude to “give the lie” to his eyes,
which were convulsively straining towards
us, from the corner of their sockets, and
scanning our every movement with an intense
and eager curiosity.</p>

<p>At length one of the party wishing to
inquire about our horses, beckoned him
forward. This was a signal for all the rest.
They came trooping up from every quarter,
under the pretence of giving information;
and upon every sign made by us,
about twenty tongues gabbled unintelligible
answers. After spending about half
an hour upon the banks, and finding that
nothing was to be gained in the way of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
information, we turned off in the direction
of the village.</p>

<p>It was now humming with life. The
warriors were collected in small knots of
five or six, and, by their vehement gestures,
were apparently engaged in earnest
conversation. The children were rolling
and tumbling in the dirt; the squaws were
busily engaged. Some were bringing from
their lodges large leather sacks of shelled
corn; others were spreading it out to dry,
upon the leather of their buffalo-skin tents,
which had been stretched out upon the
ground. Others were cleansing from it
the decayed kernels and packing it up in
small sacks of a whitish undressed leather,
resembling parchment. These were then
deposited in cache-holes<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> for a winter’s
store.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[D]</a> The <i>Cache</i>, is a large hole dug in the ground
like a cistern. It is narrow at the top (about four
feet in diameter) but wider as it descends, until its
form somewhat resembles that of a jug. It will contain
about an hundred bushels of corn.</p>

<p>Upon leaving their villages, the Indians deposit the
corn which is to serve for their winter’s store in
granaries of this description, and cover the apertures
with earth, so that it is impossible, for a person unacquainted
with their exact position, to discover the
entrance. The name <i>Cache</i> is given by the French
traders who derive it from the word <i>cacher</i> (to
conceal.)</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<p>At a distance from the village, a band
of females were slowly wending along the
top of one of the low prairie ridges, to their
daily labour in the small plantations of
corn. These are scattered in every direction
round the village, wherever a spot
of rich, black soil, gives promise of a
bountiful harvest. Some of them are as
much as eight miles distant from the
town.</p>

<p>There is a fearful uncertainty hanging
round the lives of these females. At the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
rising of the sun they depart to their toil,
often never to return. They are constantly
exposed to the attacks of lurking
foes, who steal down upon their villages,
to cut off stragglers. They come and disappear
with equal silence and celerity.
Their presence is unknown, until the long
absence of a friend, or a mutilated body,
found sometimes after the lapse of several
days, conveys to their friends a thrilling
token, that the hand of the destroyer has
been busied among them, and the hour of
vengeance has passed.</p>

<p>As we proceeded, we were again waited
upon by a committee of the dogs of the
town. They formed in a train behind us,
with the same expression of ill feeling that
had been manifested by their predecessors.
But this last display of rancour was
of short duration; for a stout, tattered Indian,
who looked as if his last ablution had
been performed during his infancy, rushed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
out from one of the lodges, and with a
few vigorous applications of his foot
changed the aspect of affairs. In an instant
the glistening eyes of the curs sunk
from fury to meekness; the hair which
bristled boldly up was sleeked quietly
down to their backs; the tails which had
stood out as erect as bars of iron, were
tucked snugly away between their legs,
and the snarls were converted into yells.
In short, the canine committee were unmercifully
beaten, and fled yelping and
howling in every direction.</p>

<p>Our attention was now called to the long,
lean, wiery old heralds, who were stalking
through the town, calling forth the warriors,
and exhorting them to prepare for
the council. Occasionally they stopped
to gossip with some gray-headed crony,
who stood blinking like an owl at the entrance
of his dwelling. At other times
they paused to bestow a little wholesome<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
advice upon some wild urchin, guilty of
some breach of decorum towards their
guests.</p>

<p>Upon reaching the lodge of the chief,
we found that active preparations had
been made for holding the council. The
goods and presents which had been received
hastily into the building, were now
piled up carefully. The lodge had been
swept clean; a large cheery fire was
crackling in the centre. The rabble
crowd of loungers and hangers-on had
been routed; and besides the family of the
chief, we were the only occupants of the
spacious building.</p>

<p>At mid-day the chiefs and braves began
to assemble. They were full dressed;
many of the young warriors had spent the
whole morning in preparation, and now
presented themselves, fully ornamented
for the meeting.</p>

<p>As the hour for the opening of the council<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
grew nearer, the tall, muffled warriors
poured in, in one continuous stream. They
moved quietly to the places allotted them,
and seating themselves in silence round
the chief, according to their rank. There
was no wrangling, or bustle for precedence;
each knew his station, and if perchance
one of them occupied the place
of some more distinguished warrior, upon
his appearance he immediately rose and
resigned them his seat.</p>

<p>The crowd continued flowing in until
the lodge was filled almost to suffocation.
As they came in, they seated themselves,
until five or six circles were formed, one
beyond the other, the last ranging against
the wall of the building. In the ring nearest
the chiefs, sat the principal braves,
or those warriors whose deeds of blood
entitled them to a high rank in the councils
of the nation. The more distant circles
were filled by such young men of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
village as were admitted to its councils.
The passage leading to the open air, was
completely blocked up with a tight wedged
mass of women and children, who dared
venture no nearer to the deliberations of
the tribe.</p>

<p>In the course of half an hour, nearly all
the principal warriors had assembled.
The chief then filled a large stone pipe
and lighting it, drew a few puffs, inhaling
the smoke into his lungs, and blowing it
out in long blasts through his nostrils.
He then passed it to the whites, who,
each having inhaled a few whiffs in their
turn, handed it to their neighbours. These
again passed it on, until it had made the
circuit of the whole assembly. While
this was going on our attention was attracted
by a violent commotion in the
passage. In a moment afterwards the
naked head and shoulders of the Wild
Horse towered above the crowd. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
forced his way through them, and burst
naked into the building. Here he seated
himself in the inner ring, leaning his back
against one of the pillars which supported
the roof. The chief scowled grimly at
the disturbance caused by his entrance.
The Wild Horse, however, was a giant,
whose wrath was not to be courted, and
the matter passed off in silence. After a
short time Mr. E—— rose and addressed
the council, stating the views of the United
States, and at the same time, the conditions
of the treaty.</p>

<p>During the whole of the address, every
sound was hushed into a deep and thrilling
silence. Not a form stirred; but all
sat with their eyes steadily fixed upon his
countenance. There was not even a long-drawn
breath to break in upon the voice
of the speaker; though now and then,
some proposal, which met with peculiar
approbation, would elicit a loud grunt of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
approval, from the deep, sonorous chests
of the whole assemblage.</p>

<p>When Mr. E—— had finished his address,
the chief of the Grand Pawnees rose
and folded his heavy buffalo-robe round
his body. His right arm and breast were
left bare. The other hand and lower
part of his body, were completely hid
by the dark folds of his shaggy mantle.
For a few moments he stood facing Mr.
E—— in silence; then stepping forward,
his chest seemed to swell out,—he threw
back his head, and raised his arm, with
one of the fingers slightly extended, as if to
command attention. He then paused and
gazed with a hawk eye upon the iron faces
of his warriors. The pause and glance
were momentary; and without moving
the position of his arm, he commenced
his harangue. It was short, energetic,
and abounding with all the high-wrought
figures of Indian oratory. As he proceeded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
he grew more and more animated; his
chest rose and fell; his finely modulated
voice, which at first had stolen like music
over the stillness, grew louder and
louder, until its deep, fierce tones rang
like thunder through the building. He
threw his robe from his shoulders, leaving
bare his almost convulsed frame. He fixed
his eagle eye upon us; he extended
his bare arms towards us, he waved them
over our heads, with a wild fury of gesticulation.
Had it not been for his words
of friendship, our fancies would have led
us to imagine him some demon, pouring
out the most fearful threats of vengeance.
For about ten minutes his voice rolled
through the lodge. Suddenly he fell from
his loud, energetic language to the silvery,
guttural tones natural to him, and in a short
time finished his harangue.</p>

<p>After him, his son, the second chief
of the tribe, rose and commenced an address.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
While he was proceeding, a noise
of voices arose at the extreme part of the
lodge, near the passage. At first they
were low and smothered; but at last they
broke out into loud and angry altercation.
The Wild Horse was crouching at
the foot of one of the pillars, with his
hands interlocked with each other, his
arms encompassing his legs, and his body
nearly hid by the long matted hair which
hung over it. He was roused by the
disturbance; but at first contented himself
by an occasional sharp word addressed
to the crowd. This silenced it for a
few moments; but at last the brawling
voices broke out into open clamour. The
savage started to his feet, stalked among
them, shook his brawny arms over their
heads, and thundered a few stern words
in their ears. This had the effect of magic
in soothing the angry passions of the
disputants. The voices sank into silence,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
and the noise was hushed. For a few moments
he maintained his menacing attitude
over them; and then resuming his station
at the foot of the pillar, the chief proceeded
in his harangue.</p>

<p>When he concluded, several chiefs
rose and addressed the party, welcoming
them to their homes, with the kindest
expressions of hospitality. At the
same time they expressed their entire acquiescence
in the terms of the treaty.
After them several of the braves and warriors
rose, and spoke to the same effect.
When they had concluded, the following
day was appointed for signing the
treaty. The pipe was again passed round,
and the council breaking up, the warriors
left the lodge.</p>

<p>During the whole of the deliberation,
which lasted about six hours, the interior
of the building was excessively hot.
The instant it was cleared, we strolled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
out into the open prairie. A large
crowd was gathered at a distance. We
went towards it, and found it assembled
to witness the slaughter of one of our
oxen—the destined victim for the ratification
of the treaty. The hunter who
was to enact the part of butcher, had
loaded his rifle, and now moved forward.
The crowd spread off on each side, leaving
the animal exposed to view. The
beast, then for the first time seemed to
have a suspicion of the fate that awaited
him, raised his head, and gazed steadily
at his butcher. The hunter took a few
steps—the gun was to his cheek—the trigger
clicked—we heard the bullet strike—the
ox reared his heavy frame, and fell forward
on the ground; but the ball had
merely fractured the skull without being
fatal. By degrees the animal raised himself
from the ground upon his haunches.
His head hung heavily forward, and a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
thin streak of blood trickled down from
the bullet hole in his forehead. Still he
feebly supported his form upon his fore
feet. His huge body rocked to and fro in
the last extremity of anguish, and deep
bellowings burst from his heaving lungs,
resembling the tortured cries of a human
sufferer. A second time the hunter advanced
and fired; the ball was fatal; it
crushed through the bone of the skull,
and the beast fell forward with a deep
groan. The crowd, raising a loud cry
of exultation and delight, closed round
him. The exhibition was sickening; we
turned away and left the Indian butchers
to their work.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

</div>

<p class="small center mb2"><i>Receiving Horses.—Departure from Grand
Pawnees.—Crossing the Platte.—The Iotan’s
Wife.</i></p>

<p>The morning at length arrived upon
which we were to take our leave of the
Grand Pawnees, and shape our course for
the village of the Pawnee Republicans.
It is situated upon the Loup fork of the
Platte river, about twenty miles distant.</p>

<p>The couriers appointed to carry the
tidings of our approach to the nation, had
left the village the night before. We
were now drawn out in the area in front
of the lodge, awaiting the movements of
the soldiers who were scattered around,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
some driving in, and others searching
for, the horses, on the small islands of the
Platte.</p>

<p>The chief of the Pawnee Republican
village, after lingering with us till the last
moment, started forward across the river.
In the dim distance we could perceive
his flake-white horse skimming like a
bird over the crests of the hills. Now
he disappeared in their deep, undulating
hollows, now he again flashed for an instant
on the eye as he passed over the
brow of some more distant ridge. He was
pushing forward to reach his village, and
marshal his warriors.</p>

<p>In about half an hour, the soldiers returned,
driving in the horses, and commenced
saddling them for the march.</p>

<p>In the meantime, those Indians who
had promised horses on the first day
of our meeting, brought them up. A
young Indian first came forward, and led<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
up a bright, jet-black mare—after him
followed another, holding in his hand a
long buffalo tug, or halter, which restrained
the wild motions of a two years’ old
colt. His colour was snowy white, here
and there broken with spots of brown.
He had been caught wild from the prairies
but a few weeks before. He was a
slave, but he had never been mounted—his
back had never bent to a burden.
They led him up in his own native wildness—his
tail stood out—his ears were
pricked up—his eyes starting—his nostrils
expanded—and every hair of his long
mane seemed almost erect with an undefinable
feeling of terror. At one moment
he dashed swiftly around at the full stretch
of the long tug which secured him—then
pausing, and shaking his long mane over
his head, he fixed the gaze of his almost
bursting eyes upon his captor. Then raising
his head, and casting a long, lingering,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
and almost despairing gaze upon the hills
of the prairie, which till then had been
his home, he made a desperate leap forward,
dragging to the ground the Indian
who held the end of his halter. Others,
however, rushed to his assistance, and held
him in. The crowd then attempted to close
round him, but he reared upon his hind
legs, and kept them at bay, with rapid and
powerful blows of his fore feet. At length
a young Indian who was standing near,
threw off his robe and crept cautiously towards
the animal from behind. With a
sudden leap he bounded upon his back,
and seized the tug, which was secured in
his mouth. Before this, the efforts of the
animal had been violent; but when he felt
the burden upon his back—when he felt
the curbing hand of his rider—he sent
up a shrill and almost frantic scream—he
bounded in the air like a wild-cat—he
reared, he plunged, but in vain; his rider<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
was a master hand, and retained his seat
as unmoved as if he had constituted part
of the animal itself. He curbed him in—he
lashed him with his heavy whip, until he
crouched like a dog upon the prairie. His
spirit was crushed; and the last spark of
freedom was extinguished. Shortly after,
one of the hunters came up and tied a
pack upon his back. He made no resistance,
and they led him off with the rest,
to finish his days in drudgery and toil.</p>

<p>In the meantime the other Indians
led up their horses. It was evident that
many of them had made their promises in
the excitement of the moment. They were
now fulfilling them as matters of conscience,
not of inclination; and their horses
were valuable in proportion. One was
lame, another blind; one had large patches
of skin galled upon his back, and the ears
of another were cropped close to his head.
In fine it was evident that they had selected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
the very worst of their animals for the
fulfilment of their promises. Our <i>stud</i>
was a collection of the maimed, the halt,
and the blind. One after another they came
lingering up, until one Indian alone lagged
behind. The chief inquired for him, and
was told that he had gone out to search
for his animal. Ten minutes elapsed. At
last there was a movement in the crowd,
and a sly-looking, old white-headed Indian
made his way through it. In his hand
he held the end of a long buffalo tug: the
other was secured to his horse. Such a
horse! he was blind of both eyes; his tail
had been cut off short to his rump; his
ribs stood out in bold relief; and his very
joints creaked, as he walked stiffly after
his leader. As for his age there was no
mode of telling it, as his teeth had long
since dropped out; but it must have been
incalculable.</p>

<p>There was a smothered giggling among<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
the women, and a downright squall of
laughter among the children, as the horse
stalked forwards towards its future owner.
The old Indian moved towards Mr. E——,
and without raising his head placed the
end of the halter in the hand of one of the
soldiers. There was a deal of mischief in
his look, and I could hear a smothered
chuckle rattling beneath the folds of his
robe, as he drew it up over his face, and
disappeared among the crowd.</p>

<p>We now mounted and started at a rapid
pace for the banks of the river. The
heavy lumbering wagons followed more
slowly, and a train of about half the village
brought up the rear.</p>

<p>Upon reaching the banks we found that
the Otoes were already on their way
through the river. Some were wading
up to their arm-pits; others, had missed
the ford, and were swept down the
stream, holding their blankets high over<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
their heads to keep them dry, as they
struggled across the rushing current.
Others, mounted on horses which they
had trafficked for with the Pawnees, were
dashing and spattering through the shallow
parts of the river, or clinging to the
manes of their steeds, as they ploughed
their way through the deep current.</p>

<p>The river at this place was nearly two
miles broad, here and there interspersed
with small islands. The depth was ever
varying; in some places it was but a few
inches, in others it must have been from
ten to twenty feet. At one moment, the
water scarce reached the fetlocks of your
horse—the next step sent him floundering
up to the holsters.</p>

<p>After reaching the banks of the river,
a short consultation was held. The heavy
baggage wagons were then sent forward,
with two Indians to guide them over the
ford. After them followed the dearborn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
wagons. One was driven by an old soldier,
who kept steadily in the wake of
the teams. Two mules drew the other.
They were driven by our half-French,
half-devil Joe, who was seated upon the
dash-board of the wagon, swearing in
broken English, sometimes at the animals,
and at others, at the slow pace of
the oxen which dragged the wagons in
front. For some time, he followed steadily
in their train; but at length his patience
became exhausted, and he determined
to drive forward at all hazards.
He plied his whip upon the flanks of the
mules. At the first application they stopped
short—at the second they kicked
up—but at the third they commenced
moving forward—for they had learnt by
long experience, that the patience and
perseverance of their driver in the application
of the lash, were sufficient to overcome
even their own almost inexhaustible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
fund of obstinacy, and ill nature. Half a
dozen steps brought the water up to the
bottom of the wagon. The mules doubted,
but the driver whipped on. Another
half a dozen steps, and the water gushed
over the sides into the wagon—still the
lash was busy. The next moment the
beasts were swimming, with only the tips
of their noses and ears, visible above the
surface. The wagon had disappeared beneath
the water, and the head of the driver,
shaded by a broad-brimmed hat, went
skimming along the surface, pouring out a
steady stream of French and English oaths,
jumbled into one common mass. Occasionally
an arm was flourished above the
water, inflicting a little chastisement upon
the nose and ears of the animals, which
caused them to dip under the water, with
a prodigious increase of snorting, but not
much acceleration of speed. At length,
however, the deep water was passed, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
after drifting about a hundred yards down
the river, the wagon gradually rose above
the surface, and travelled slowly up the
opposite bank.</p>

<p>The rest of the party then commenced
their march in Indian file across the ford,
keeping in a line with a tall Indian, who
led the way. Most of the party followed
the guide; but some of our horses were
restive, and missing the ford, drifted us a
short distance down the stream, where we
reached a small island, and scrambling
up its bank, galloped across to the opposite
side.</p>

<p>Here we found a wife of the Iotan
chief, standing on the edge of the water.
She had accompanied him from his village.
She was young, tall, and finely
formed; her face, next to that of
the wife of the Kioway Indian, was the
most beautiful we had met with. Her
hair was parted across her forehead,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
and hung down upon her shoulders. A
small jacket of blue cloth, was fastened
round her shoulders and breast, and a
mantle of the same, was wrapped around
her body. They had been presented
to her by the commissioner, but a few
days before. She was standing upon a
small sand-bar, and the water was gurgling
around her feet; a short distance
in front of her, a deep channel was rushing
with a powerful current. She looked at
the water, and then at her dress, with an
expression of almost childish sorrow, for,
to swim the river would ruin her finery.
The Indians had all reached the opposite
bank, and were waiting for the rest to
come up, so that no assistance could be
expected from them.</p>

<p>Just then the hunters dashed by her,
into the deep channel, but did not even
notice her. I was the last of the party,
and she knew it; for though we could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
not speak the same language, there was
an imploring expression in her large dark
eye as she fixed it upon me, that told
every thing. Still I hesitated: I thought
of pushing on; there was a powerful struggle
between selfishness and a desire to assist
her; she saw it, and speaking a few
words in her own silvery tongue, she at
the same time pointed to her new dress.</p>

<p>There was something so sorrowful in the
tone and gesture, that I could not resist it.
I took my rifle in my left hand, and reaching
out my right, she seized it; she placed
her foot on mine, and, with a sudden bound,
was upon the back of my horse, stooping
behind me, with her arms round my neck.
The horse had so long been accustomed to
have his own way in every thing, that he
grew very indignant at this new imposition—but
a lunge of the spurs subdued
his wrath, and he bounded forward into
the rushing river. He was a powerful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
animal, and took to the water like a sea-fowl.
The river rushed and roared around
us, and we could feel the strong nervous
quivering of his limbs, as he bore up against
it. But occasionally as he went snorting
along, he cast back spiteful glances at his
riders. I expected mischief, and it came
to pass. We felt his hoofs touch the bottom—three
leaps—he was up the bank—his
heels flew in the air—the arms of
the squaw were jerked violently from my
neck, and I saw her describing a somerset
through the air; she landed upon her feet
and received no injury. The Indians
raised a shout of laughter, and the horse,
satisfied with being relieved from his extra
burden, jogged quietly on towards
the Republican village.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

</div>

<p class="small center mb2"><i>Journey to the Republican Village, and Reception.</i></p>

<p>In about half an hour, our whole troop
were safely landed on the bank of the
Platte, opposite the town of the Grand
Pawnees. In the faint distance we could
perceive the inhabitants, still standing
upon the tops of the lodges, and watching
our movements. A few who had lingered
in our train, and crossed the river with
us, now prepared to return. After sunning
themselves for a short time on the
dry grass, to take off the chill they had
received in swimming across the cold
current, they again plunged into the
river. Their dark heads and bodies, were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
seen scattered over its whole breadth;
until shut out from our view by one of the
hills of the prairie.</p>

<p>The distance between the Grand Pawnee,
and the Pawnee Republican Village,
is about twenty miles. The last is situated
upon what is called the Loup Fork of the
Platte river, and is about the same in size,
as that of the Grand Pawnees. The different
portions of the tribe who live upon
this river, were formerly united. In the
course of time, however, as their numbers
increased, the difficulty of obtaining timber
for fuel and building, also increased,
until at last they divided into four distinct
bands, each under a separate chief. The
first seated itself upon the Republican Fork
of the Platte, and is known by the name of
the Grand Pawnee tribe. The other three
located themselves upon the Loup Fork
of the same river, and are distinguished by
the names of the Republican Pawnees, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
Tappaye Pawnees, and the Pawnee Loups.
They are altogether distinct from the Pawnee
Picks, and speak not the same tongue.
During our stay among the Grand Pawnees,
we found a Pawnee Pick residing
among them, but his language was unintelligible
to the whole nation, with the exception
of one Indian, who had resided
among his people.</p>

<p>Our journey now lay across the prairie.
An advance guard of about twenty Pawnees
took the lead, conducting a number of
loaded mules. Sometimes they were only
ten or fifteen rods ahead, and then would
push forward until we nearly lost sight of
them. Behind us straggled our little band
of Otoes; all on foot, except the wife of the
Iotan chief. She had contrived by her
winning arts, to soften the flinty nature of
the old iron-sided soldier who drove one
of the wagons, so as to get a seat upon a
pile of bear-skins, composing our bedding.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
Here she exerted herself, to maintain her
hold in the good will of the veteran Jehu,
by narrating to him by gestures, an account
of her passage over the Platte.</p>

<p>The soldier listened to her patiently,
and occasionally condescended to smile,
when by her gesticulation, the story appeared
to warrant it the most. At length
one of his comrades rode up and asked:</p>

<p>“What are you and the wife of Iotan
laughing at, Mack?”</p>

<p>“Curse me if I know,” retorted the
other. “The squaw keeps up such a
<i>bloody</i> cackling, I suppose there must be
some joke, and so I laughed.”</p>

<p>After travelling a few hours over the
prairie, we passed a single tree. It stood
like a solitary sentinel, to guard the waters
of a small spring, which gushed out at its
foot; the source of the only brook, which
had crossed our path, during the whole
route. The tree was an aged one; short,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
and sturdy. If aught might be judged
from its gnarled and fantastically twisted
limbs, it had maintained its station for
centuries, contending against the fierce
storms and tornados, which had swept the
prairie. We felt a kind of companionship
with this “veteran of the storms;” and as
if by common consent, the party, both Indians
and whites, came to a halt, to rest
under its branches, and drink of the water
which gurgled along at its roots.</p>

<p>In a quarter of an hour we again pushed
forward. After an hour more of laborious
travel, through long waving grass, we
descried large droves of horses, with uplifted
heads and erect manes, gazing at us
from the different eminences. We perceived
also the flying forms of mounted
Indians, in the distance, and groups of
others clad in flowing robes, and standing
like statues upon the heights. This showed
us that the town was not distant, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
that its warriors were on the watch for our
coming. Intervening hills, however, still
shut it out from our sight. As we proceeded,
the groups disappeared one after
another, and as we mounted the eminences
where they had stood, we could perceive
them, dashing forward, until they sank behind
the brow of a high ridge, which still
hid the town.</p>

<p>In half an hour, we ascended this ridge,
and halted upon its top. A large plain, of
about two miles in extent, lay at its foot.
It was bounded by the waters of the
Loup Fork, glittering through the verdant
foliage which fringed its borders.
On the opposite side of the river, was a
high bluff, on which was situated the dingy
lodges of the Republican village.</p>

<p>The plain in front of us, was alive with
Indians. We had come upon them before
they were prepared for our reception.
Large troops were scouring the plain, apparently
without an object. Single Indians<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
were galloping in different directions;
some up the banks of the river, and
others towards the village. The tall form
of the chief, mounted on his white horse,
was seen dashing to and fro among the
bands, giving his orders, and assigning to
all their several stations. In a few moments,
a torrent of warriors poured down
the steep bank, which led from the village.
They plunged into the river, forced a
foaming path through its water, broke
their way through the thicket on its brink,
and bounded over the plain, to the spot
where the chief awaited their coming. A
second confusion now seemed to take
place, and all the different squads of horsemen
congregated together, as if awaiting
directions. This continued for a short
time. The chief then detached himself
from the crowd and galloped a few yards
in front, and calling out a single warrior
sent him towards us. The whole scene
at our feet, was like the distant perspective<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
of a panorama. The approaching
warrior seemed at first to crawl along at a
snail’s pace. But when he drew nearer,
we could hear the heavy tramp of his
horse’s hoofs, and see that his speed was
furious.</p>

<p>He plied the lash, and kept at full
stretch, until within a few paces of us.
Then by a powerful effort, the horse was
drawn almost erect in the air, and stopped
in his mad career, as suddenly as if converted
into stone. His rider sprang from
him, and advanced to the Interpreter.
He bore a request from the chief, that
the party would descend into the plain,
where his warriors could receive them in
better style.</p>

<p>The request was obeyed, and in about
twenty minutes, upon receiving a second
message from the chief, we drew up to
await the coming of his warriors.</p>

<p>The leader, who still maintained his
stand in front of the mass, then waved his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
arm. At this motion the band separated.
A large body remained stationary, while
an equal number galloped several hundred
yards, to the right and left of the
main division, and halted with their horses
heading towards the party.</p>

<p>For a short time the chief stood watching
the actions of both. It was not until
he saw that every man was at his post,
and every form as unmoved as stone,
that he gave the signal. Then raising his
arm, he wheeled his horse round, and
sent up a long quavering whoop. Before
it died away, a thousand throats
had echoed back its ringing tones, and a
thousand voices lent their aid in raising a
cry, which almost shook the prairie.
Although accustomed to its sound, and
although we knew, that there was not a
hand in that band, but would be extended
towards us in friendship, yet its wild
fierceness fairly caused us to shiver. At
the same time the impulse was given to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
the horses. At first their movements
were regular, but before a hundred yards
had been passed, each man sent up his
shrillest cry, urged his steed forward to
the utmost stretch of his speed, and the
whole band came dashing forward in wild
confusion. At the distance of about a
hundred yards in front of us, the three
divisions met, but for a moment; then
separating, the torrent whirled in a circle
round us at the same mad gait. Through
the whole mass, we could perceive the powerful
form of the chief. He was urging his
steed round in the innermost circle; and
above the loud din of whoops and yells,
we could hear the tones of his trumpet
voice, cheering his warriors onward in
their wild course.</p>

<p>After this had continued for a short
time, he made another signal, and one after
another the whole band checked their
horses, and became motionless. Then dismounting,
a great number of them loosed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
the tugs from their beasts, and cast them
loose to career at will over the prairie.
The chiefs, however, and the principal
men of the nation, still remained on horseback
to escort the party into the village.</p>

<p>When the band had seated themselves
around, the same ceremony of presenting
horses was repeated, which had taken
place at the arrival of the party at the
village of the Grand Pawnees.</p>

<p>About the same number were given as
on the preceding occasion. As before,
the old men who had nothing to offer,
made up for it in speeches, exhorting
others to munificence. They possessed
in a high degree that generosity which is
indulged at the expense of one’s neighbours,
and gains great applause from the
world.</p>

<p>When this ceremony was finished, the
circle opened, and our troop again mounting,
prepared for their journey to the village.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

</div>

<p class="small center mb2"><i>Indian Mischief.—Crossing the Loup Fork of
the Platte.—Entrance in the Republican
Village.</i></p>

<p>No sooner had the chief signified by
his movements his intention that the party
should set out, than the dark ring round
us was broken, and the whole mass of
Indians flooded the prairie—pouring in
the direction of their village. It was a
scene of vast confusion. The horses
which had been cast loose by their owners,
careered wildly around the crowd.
The mounted horsemen dashed about with
a mad fury almost equal to that of the
masterless beasts. If any thing could give
to an inexperienced person an idea of a
field of battle, where man and horse are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
alike urged on by a reckless disregard of
life, it is a scene like this.</p>

<p>There was a striking contrast between
the conduct of the older and more influential
chiefs, and that of the younger warriors.
The first rode gravely by the side
of the party. There was something stern,
and even savage, in the fixed repose of
their painted faces.</p>

<p>Every forehead was wrinkled with the
thousand lines that seam an Indian brow;
and, but for the tell-tale eyes which glittered
in their deep-sunk sockets with a
startling brilliancy, you would not have
known that boiling blood, and hearts which
could nourish passions like fire, were
beating in the bosoms of those iron warriors.</p>

<p>These were the chiefs and older men
of the tribe; the young men rode at a
distance. There was nothing to restrain
<i>them</i>; they took no part in the councils.
Their chiefs had ordered them to receive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
the party as friends, and they had obeyed
their orders. They knew that a treaty
of peace was to be made with the
whites. They knew that in future the
axe and scalping knife were to lie idle,
and that war was to be at an end. But they
did <i>not</i> know, that they were thus removing
the only barrier which insured their
own safety, and were forming the first
link of the chain, which always has ended,
and always will end in fetters to the free
spirit of the Indian.</p>

<p>During the whole way from the plain to
the bank of the river, the party kept compactly
together. At length, however, one
of the soldiers, mounted upon a powerful
horse, gradually edged away, until he was
about fifty yards distant from the main
body. It was done without thought, and
probably for the sake of gaining space that
his horse might move more freely. He
had reached some distance, and gained
a point, beyond the observation of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
chief. Here the spirit of waggery and mischief,
which flourishes with rich growth
in the bosom of a young Indian, began to
display itself in the various pranks which
they attempted to play upon him. Frequently
they would flit their horses across
his path, and in passing, dashed their
heavy robes across the eyes of the animal
causing him to rear, and plunge. This was
a source of great annoyance to the rider,
who was not the best horseman in the
world, and had been mounted that day
more for the sake of show, than for any
desire which he had for the station.
He did well enough as long as his
steed travelled at a walk. He was most
sorely puzzled when his speed was accelerated,
and completely driven to his
wit’s end, when the horse grew restive
under the annoyances of the Indians.
<i>They</i>, however, always took especial care
to be quick in their movements, and keep
beyond the reach of his brawny arm; for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
there was something in the grave, worried
features, and giant form of the veteran,
which spoke a man not to be trifled with.
For some time this continued, and he bore
it with exemplary patience. At last a
little, old wiery Indian, half covered with
a buffalo robe, which from long use retained
but little of its woolly covering,
determined to come in for his share of
the sport. He was mounted upon a little
horse, of as lean and sinewy a make as
himself, with an eye as fiery as a coal.
He had no hair upon his tail, but at the
successful accomplishment of any of his
mischievous feats, he wagged the naked
stump with an expression of keen satisfaction
and relish.</p>

<p>At first the old fellow contented himself
by whirling his beast round and round the
powerful horse, which bore the veteran;
and so near as almost to touch him at every
circuit. The soldier did not appear to
relish this, but still took no active measure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
in the defensive. Finding that this was
borne with patience, the old fellow grew
bolder. In making one of his circuits, he
ran his steed violently against the flank of
the horse which bore the soldier, casting
the rider from his precarious seat, almost
on the neck of his beast, and causing a
furious discharge of the heels of the aggrieved
animal. At last the old Indian
came to still closer quarters, and galloped
full tilt against the horse, while a loud
laugh was raised among the young Indians.
The soldier recovered his seat, but began
to lose his temper, and when the old man
repeated his manœuvre he became downright
angry. The most of the Indians saw
that there was mischief in his eye, and
drew off. The old man, however, was too
much delighted with the success of his
pranks to think of stopping. In the meantime
the soldier made preparation to retaliate.
The horse upon which he was
mounted was of a very large size. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
had relished as little as his rider, the rigs
that his tormentors had run upon him.
The soldier knew this, and acted accordingly.
As the Indian came again at full
sweep, to run aboard of him, he suddenly
drew in the powerful curb bridle, with a
strong jerk, and at the same time buried
his spurs in the flanks of his horse. The
animal planted his fore feet into the sod,
and his heels were discharged from behind
as if thrown from a catapult. They
came in contact with the ribs of his opponent’s
horse, at the moment that he was
about to close with him. The nag was
driven to the distance of several yards,
and the rider hurled from his back, and
sent rolling in the grass.</p>

<p>Though the Indians had relished the
pranks played by their comrade, their
enjoyment of the retaliation was greater;
and they hooted, and jeered him, not so
much for his breach of hospitality as for
his want of success. To get rid of them,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
he plied the lash upon his little steed, and
together they went scampering to the village.
The soldier in the meantime, taking
advantage of the diversion in his favour,
returned to the party.</p>

<p>A short time only elapsed, before we
were at the brink of the river. Here the
chief led the way across the shoalest fording
place. The rest of the Indians, however,
regardless of the depth, plunged in,
and in a few moments, its whole surface
was black with them.</p>

<p>It was a scene of great hubbub and confusion.
Some were mounted upon powerful,
and sinewy horses, which sped through
the water like sea-birds. Others floundered,
half drowning through the deep channel,
frightening the more timid by their
snorting and splashing. Some of the Indians
threw themselves from their steeds,
and boldly stemmed the current, half swimming,
and half wading; while the relieved
horses, scattering in every direction,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
ploughed their way through the bubbling
stream, and made for the nearest land.
The baggage wagons toiled slowly along
in the rear, keeping closely upon the trail
of the chief.</p>

<p>After some time the whole party reached
the opposite shore, at the foot of the
high bluff, upon which stood the Republican
village. The bank was steep, and
almost precipitous. There was a pause of
some length, before the arduous task of
dragging the heavy vehicles up the hill,
was imposed upon the jaded oxen. At
length, however, a string of twelve were
fastened before a single wagon, and united
their strength to draw it up. The Indians
stood by, with looks of wondering curiosity;
but when they saw the lash inflicted,
and the nervous efforts of the beasts, they
shrank back with a feeling of fear, lest
they should turn upon their persecutors.
Even the older warriors showed signs of
dread, and the children scampered in undisguised<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
terror up the steep pathway.
They paused, however, upon the top of
the bluff, where they deemed that they
might gaze in safety, upon the movements
of their guests. After a sound drubbing,
and much swearing on the part of the
drivers, the jaded animals forced the wagons
up the hill, and slowly proceeded
through the village.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

</div>

<p class="small center mb2"><i>Indian Females and Feasts.</i></p>

<p>Many of the inhabitants of this town
had been present at our arrival at the
Grand Pawnee village, and to them the
novelty of our appearance was over. To
the rest, however, more particularly the
women and children, all was new, and
our day of entering into the town, was one
of jubilee. We found the pathway lined
with women and children, and the spaces
between the lodges, crowded with them.
Here and there were knots of wild-looking
boys, with their bows and arrows tucked
under their arms, staring with open
mouths, upon the travelling lodges as they
termed our heavy wagons. Groups too of
females—the married women with troops of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
children—some on their backs and others
at their heels, crowded round. Young
and beautiful girls, also, wild as deer,
were gazing at us with deep curiosity,
but maintained a timid distance.</p>

<p>The most dauntless of the crowd, were
two or three old crones, squalid and dirty
in the extreme, and who, if aught might
be judged from their looks, were the oldest
women that ever lived. Every thing was
withered about them, but their tongues,
which still flourished with the vigour of
former years. They were like racers:
they had run against time, and gained the
heat. Each of these beldames singled out
her victim, from among the members of our
party, and exerted herself to the utmost
to render his situation agreeable, by dinning
his ears with her garrulity.</p>

<p>Another worthy of this class, had been
entrusted with the care of about a dozen
children of all ages and sexes. These she
had ranged upon the dome-like top of one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
of the lodges to see the spectacle, as we
passed by. She stood in front of her
elfish brood, keeping at bay by the violent
exertions of both tongue and talons, the
crowd, who, in their anxiety to obtain a
view, were attempting to invade her sanctuary.</p>

<p>The persons who had placed their little
goblin young ones in her charge, understood
well her nature. Her tongue
knew no rest. At one moment it was
busy in bestowing a shower of wholesome
advice, upon some refractory little urchin,
whose curiosity would not permit him to
sit easy; and at another it was waging a
wordy war with the passers by. She
fluttered, and ruffled round her bevy, with
all the peevish irritability of an old wet-nurse
hen, placed in charge of a family of
graceless young ducks, who need all her
advice and attention, to keep them from
danger.</p>

<p>After winding our way through the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
town, we at length came to the lodge of
Blue Coat,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> the chief of this village. He
had nothing of the stern coldness of the
leader of the Grand Pawnees. He attended
personally and assiduously to our
comfort—assisting even in unloading, and
bringing in our baggage. When this was
finished, he seated himself and opened
a conversation, through the interpreter.
There was an intelligence in his remarks,
and an ease in his manners, which almost
made his guests forget they were conversing
with a wild, untutored savage.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[E]</a> The name of Blue Coat, is given to the chief of
the Republican Pawnees on account of his wearing
a blue camblet coat. He is proud of the title and
prefers it to his Indian one. He is much more
refined in his manners and ideas than the rest of his
nation, and is considered by the traders, and his own
people, the very <i>beau ideal</i> of an Indian warrior.</p>

</div>

<p>It was not long before the lodge became
crowded. The old warriors, moved with
a hushed step, across the building, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
listened, to our conversation. Occasionally,
some distinguished brave stalked in.
There was a great difference between his
manners, and those of the less noted warriors.
The latter, stole quietly into the
lodge, taking their stations in some remote
and retired nook, as if they entertained a
doubt of their privilege of entry. But as
to the former, the bold and lofty carriage;
the swelling chest; the uplifted head;
the slightly expanded nostril; the keen
searching eye, which flashed daringly
around, showed him to be one who owned
no ruler, and who knew that none in
that assembly, would dare dispute his
will. He would take his seat in the
most conspicuous part of the lodge, and
gaze calmly, and silently upon the strangers.</p>

<p>It was not long before messengers came
from different lodges, inviting us to feasts,
which had been prepared in honour of our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
arrival. We had learned by this time,
that there was no escape from the invitations
of an Indian host, so we followed the
guide, who led us to the dwelling of the
second chief.</p>

<p>We found him seated upon a small
leather mat. He was a fat, oily fellow,
with a jolly, good-natured face. Still
its expression was tempered by that gravity,
which, from long habit, has become
almost natural to the race, and proverbial
among the whites.</p>

<p>Around him were lounging about a
dozen Indians. Some, reclining with their
backs against the pillars supporting the
roof, with their eyes half closed, were
smoking their stone pipes. Some were
lying half asleep upon the clay floor, with
their feet within a few inches of the fire;
and others were keeping up a sleepy
song.</p>

<p>At a short distance from the fire, half a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
dozen squaws were pounding corn, in
large mortars,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> and chattering vociferously
at the same time. In the farther part
of the building, about a dozen naked children,
with faces almost hid by their bushy,
tangled hair, were rolling and wrestling
upon the floor, occasionally causing the
lodge to echo to their childish glee. In
the back ground, we could perceive some
half a dozen shaggy, thievish-looking wolf-dogs,
skulking among the hides and bundles,
in search of food, and gliding about
with the air of dogs, who knew that they
had no business there.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[F]</a> The mortar is in universal use among the uncivilized
tribes, answering the purpose of a mill.
The hollow is formed, by kindling a fire upon the
top of a block of wood, into which it gradually sinks
itself, until it forms a sort of bowl. The cavity is
then cleansed from the coal-black, and is fit for use.</p>

<p>These mortars are generally a foot in diameter,
and about eight inches deep. Corn is pulverised in
them, by using a billet of wood as a pestle.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span></p>

<p>Upon our entering, the lounging Indians
roused themselves from the floor; the
smokers woke from their reveries, and the
dogs slunk out of sight. The women and
children, however, went on as before, the
former pounding and chattering, and the
latter frolicking over the floor. When
we had seated ourselves, a large bowl of
boiled buffalo flesh was placed before us,
and signs made for us to fall to. The
chief himself acted as master of ceremonies.
He thrust his hands into the bowl,
and turned over and over the heap of
smoking meat, selecting the best morsels,
and welcoming us with warmest expressions
of friendship. Several times, appearing
to be annoyed by the noise and clamour
of his wives, he turned round, and
let out a volley of angry words, which,
however, they treated with no attention.
There is but little doubt that he was a
hen-pecked husband, for with all his jovial
appearance, there was a cowering look<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
about his eye, when he met the vinegar
glance of one or two of his oldest wives.</p>

<p>Before we had finished with him, half a
dozen different messengers had assembled
in the lodge, waiting for us to follow them
to the abode of some of the other chiefs. It
is customary for the guest, when he is unable
to dispose of the whole provision
placed before him, to send what is left to
his own quarters. The duty of carrying it,
is generally entrusted to one of the junior
members of the family, who when departing
upon his errand, receives a particular
caution from the squaws to be careful and
bring back the bowl.</p>

<p>It was near sunset when we finished our
visits. We had gone from lodge to lodge,
followed by a crowd of men, women, and
children, until we had visited nearly half
the dwellings in the village. Our receptions
were different, according to the dispositions
of our hosts. Some were stern
and solemn in their demeanour, and others<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
as sociable, and even lively as the whites.
In some of the lodges, the females were of
an acid temper, and to these our presence
was not as agreeable as we could have wished.
They made no hesitation in speaking
their minds to the half-breed interpreter,
who in turn, with iron gravity, translated
the whole to us, without abating an epithet,
or softening a single peppery expression.</p>

<p>When we emerged, we found a small
crowd collected in front, which drew back
as we appeared. Curious as they were,
there was nothing troublesome or forward
in their mode of gratifying their curiosity.
The children followed at a distance. The
older Indians would mark the route which
we must take, and then hurrying on,
would seat themselves in some situation,
where the whole party must pass in review
before them. There was none of the
prying, meddling spirit which is shown
among the whites.</p>

<p>We had scarcely reached the lodge of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
the chief, and were congratulating ourselves
that the eating part of the business
was terminated, when the heavy bear-skin
which hung over the mouth, was flapped
back, and a boy came across to the place
where the Interpreter was sitting. This
immediately caused us to suspect that
another feast was on foot, and we were
making for the door, when we were arrested
by the Interpreter, who was too
much of an Indian not to relish these
eating parties. He shouted out, that
three of us had been invited to attend at
the lodge of one of the older warriors, who
had prepared something which he thought
would be more acceptable than buffalo
flesh and corn. Although but little inclined
to attempt any thing in the way of
eating, still we determined to accompany
him, for we were curious to see what new
article of food, could be raked up in the
village, where every soul seemed to live
on buffalo flesh and corn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span></p>

<p>Following our guide, therefore, after a
dark walk we reached the place of invitation.</p>

<p>The interior of the lodge was illumined
by the light of a bright fire, burning
cheerily in the centre. In front
of it was seated the warrior who had invited
us. He was an old man with a bottle
nose, and a most ponderous corporation;
and when seated behind it with his feet
doubled under him after the Turkish fashion,
he looked like a large sphere.</p>

<p>Upon our entrance, after sundry puffs
and heaves, he rose to his feet, and welcomed
us, pointing out seats upon several
mats which had been placed for us, at his
side. He then told his squaw, whose
leanness was in proportion to his rotundity,
to place before us the article to be
disposed of. We watched her narrowly
as she moved to a large kettle hanging
over the fire. There was something in it
of a reddish-yellow colour. What could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
it be? We had never fallen upon any
article of that description before. The
squaw seized upon a long, sharp-pointed
stick, and commenced spearing into the
pot; but at every attempt the active occupant
contrived to dodge from her weapon,
in spite of her efforts. However, it is an
old adage, that “perseverance conquers
all difficulties,” and at length she struck
the object of her search, and drew out, impaled
upon the point of her weapon, a
large boiled <i>pumpkin</i>. This she immediately
commenced dividing in strips.</p>

<p>While the ceremony of spearing had
been going on, we watched with some curiosity,
to see what all this trouble was to
produce; but when the pumpkin made its
appearance, the expression of countenances
was most ruefully changed. I looked round
towards my companions. Their eyes were
fixed with silent agony upon the preparing
feast. There was no retreat—it must be
eaten; and we were the persons who were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
doomed to do it. I had hoped to derive a
little comfort from them. I had hoped too,
that they might relish a sodden and water-soaked
pumpkin; and that under cover of
their appetites, I might escape unobserved.
The expression, however, of their
faces forbade the idea, and I determined
to perform my share of the mastication, in a
manner creditable to a civilized man.</p>

<p>We fell to desperately, therefore, under
the vigilant eye of our fat host, who was
continually plying us with fresh pieces,
according to the laws of Indian hospitality,
and to refuse which would be regarded
as a slight. How we managed to get
through that vegetable feast, I can hardly
say; it was one of the severest trials of the
whole of our campaign; yet we did get
through with it, and emerged from the
lodge in safety.</p>

<p>When we returned to the abode of the
chief we found it crowded. Groups were
squatting in every direction, wrapped in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
their robes, indulging in a low, muttered
conversation. This was occasionally
broken by a deep, emphatic exclamation,
which always bursts with a convulsive
sound from the chest of an Indian, when
engaged in a debate of some interest. But
upon our return the conversation gradually
flagged, and their sole occupation was to
sit, with their eyes fastened upon us, as
we were collected round the fire.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

</div>

<p class="small center mb2"><i>The Doctor’s Adventure.—Indian Dirge.</i></p>

<p>When we had at first collected together
in the chief lodge, we found that one of
the party, Dr. M——, was not present.
There were many conjectures as to his absence,
but after a while he made his appearance.
He was considerably out of
breath, and related to us an adventure
which he had just met with, or rather
which he had forced himself into. He
had remained in the lodge after we left
it, to attend at our last feast. Having
nothing in particular to employ him, he
slapped his white beaver, which turned
up all around, upon the top of his head,
girded his deer-skin hunting shirt closely
around him, and thrusting his hand into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
his breeches-pocket, set out upon a voyage
of discovery. He had not travelled far
before his attention was attracted by a
low chanting song, proceeding from one
of the lodges which stood a little apart
from the others, and near the edge of the
bluff, overlooking the river.</p>

<p>Without a moment’s hesitation, he walked
towards it, entered the low, funnel
shaped mouth, and peeped over the bear-skin
which hung before the inner entrance,
opening immediately into the lodge.</p>

<p>A large fire was burning cheerfully in
the centre. Over it hung a kettle which
was kept constantly stirred by an old Indian,
dressed in a buffalo robe, whitened
with chalk, and ornamented with hieroglyphic
symbols. As he stirred he hummed
a low chant, occasionally raising his
voice until he caused it to sound loudly
through the whole building, and then again
sinking it, until it reached the ear of the
listener, in low and almost inaudible murmurs.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
There was something wild, and
rather forbidding in the features of this
individual.</p>

<p>A few steps from the fire, lay two forms,
completely covered by a heavy buffalo
robe; and bending over these stood another
Indian, dressed similar to the first.
He too, was humming a low song, at intervals
dancing to a slow measure round the
robe.</p>

<p>The doctor suspected that these were
Medecin-Men,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> and that they were performing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
some of the miraculous cures,
which they boast of in the village, and
which give them a reputation for superior
sanctity among the credulous Indians, who
believe them to hold communion with
the Great Spirit. Their ability to perform
these cures, arises frequently, from their
superior knowledge, of the hidden medicinal
virtues of different herbs. By jumbling
with their healing art, an unintelligible
species of mystic mummery, and by
pretending to hold a direct intercourse
with the Deity, the cure of their patients
is attributed more to his immediate interference,
than to any virtue of the medicines
which they have received.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="label">[G]</a> Every tribe of Indians has its Medecin-Men.
They are a kind of priest or prophet. Their influence,
however, is very variable, and depends upon
the popularity which they may have acquired with
the nation. As long as they confine their prophecies
to those events, which they know will be agreeable,
so long are they regarded with high veneration; but
as soon as they commence predictions of evil—or attempt
to reveal unpalatable truths, their influence
wanes, themselves are shunned, and their predictions
scorned.</p>

<p>They are also skilled in the virtues of herbs, and
act as physicians in healing the sick. From this
they have derived the name of Medecin, (signifying
in French, physician.)</p>

</div>

<p>After humming round them, the Medecin
raised the edge of the robe, exposing
the naked heads and shoulders of two old,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
shrivelled squaws. The person at the fire,
then reached to the other a large dipper,
filled with part of the contents of the kettle,
which was greedily swallowed by the
squaws. The robe was then thrown over
them, and again the Medecin commenced
his hum and dance.</p>

<p>Now the Doctor was a curious man,
and although he saw every thing that was
going on in the inside of the lodge, as distinctly
as if he had been there himself,
still he was determined to see more. For
a moment he paused to reflect, whether it
would be prudent to intrude upon these
mystic ceremonies, and risk incurring the
anger of such influential persons, as he
knew these Medecin-men to be. But prudence
was a quality with which he was not
much troubled; so without more hesitation
he kicked up the bear-skin, and stepped
boldly into the lodge, in front of the two
priests.</p>

<p>For a moment they gazed at him, as if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
they doubted their senses. Their eyes
flashed fire, and raising their voices, they
made the lodge ring with their yells. At
this unusual sound, the two old women
raised the robe, peeped from under it,
and seeing the white man, added their
voices to the chorus.</p>

<p>After gazing for a moment, the Doctor
attempted to approach the fire, but the
Indians warned him back, ordering him
with menacing gestures, to leave the lodge.
These he pretended to misunderstand, at
the same time attempting to enter into a
parley with them, in order to gain as much
time as possible for observation. Still they
placed themselves before him, sternly ordering
him to depart. He attempted to
explain to them that he was a Medecin-Man
in his own country, and wished to be
acquainted with their secrets, and that in
return he would communicate his. But
it was useless; either they did not understand
him, or they did not value his information,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
for they persisted in their ordering
him to quit the lodge. The Doctor
then determining, at all events, to obtain
a look into the kettle, darted round
them, and made for the fire.</p>

<p>There was now something of menace in
their faces; and one of them rushing to
the side of the lodge, seized a large club,
resting against one of the pillars. The
Doctor took to flight, and stopped not,
until he arrived, most villanously out of
wind, at the chief’s lodge, where he narrated
his adventure.</p>

<p>After this I strolled out with one of my
companions. It was so late that there
were few of the Indians stirring. Here
and there, we encountered individuals sitting
upon the high bank, gazing upon the
gliding waters of the Platte. It seemed
as if they were engaged in a species of
devotion, for they did not heed our approach,
but sat humming a low, a very
low muttered song. We passed them,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
and continued our course along the high
bluff, looking down upon the Platte, which
was dimly seen, reflecting the stars that
twinkled upon its restless water. The
prairie insects were piping their evening
calls, and the creaking of the thousand
creatures, who were hid in its long matted
herbage, told that they were conscious
their hour of song and revelry had
come. Occasionally we heard the long
howl of a wolf, softened by the distance,
and now and then some serenading owl,
would raise his voice from the dark fringe
of trees, which drooped over the opposite
bank of the river, and send forth a long
quavering whoop.</p>

<p>We strolled along the bank for half
a mile, glad to be free from the well-meant
though tedious attentions of our hosts. At
length, however, we turned for the purpose
of retracing our steps, when our attention
was attracted by a low, mournful
cry, from the midst of a number of small<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
mounds, at a short distance, the burial
ground of the village. We approached
the spot so cautiously, as not to disturb
the person who was stationed there. Upon
the top of one of the graves, a large mound
covered with grass, was lying an Indian
girl. Her buffalo robe had escaped from
her shoulders, and her long dishevelled
black hair, was mingled with the grass of
the prairie. Her bosom was resting upon
the sod, and her arms extended, as if
embracing the form of the being who was
mouldering beneath.</p>

<p>Believing that she was some female belonging
to the tribe, singing a dirge over
the grave of some departed friend, we
listened attentively to her song. At one
moment, it would rise in the air with a
plaintive sound, as if she was dwelling
with mournful tenderness, upon the virtues
of the deceased. At times, she would
seem to speak of the feelings of his heart;
at others, the note would seem to be one of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
war, of battle; and then her song would
burst from her, with the startling energy
of a person, who was in the midst of the
scene itself, and was acting over the feats
of the silent dead. At these moments,
she raised her head, and her whole frame
seemed swelling with the inspiration of
her theme; but in the very midst of this
energetic burst of enthusiasm, the chord
of some more mournful recollection would
be touched, and the song would sink from
its high, and ardent tone, to a note of wo,
so despairing, that it appeared as if the
sluices of her heart were opened, and the
deep-hidden stream of her affection, was
flowing out in the mournful melody.</p>

<p>After a short time she rose from the
ground, and wrapping her robe round
her, walked slowly towards the village.
It was not until she was completely lost
to our sight, that we left our sheltering
place, and followed in the direction which
she had taken. We had heard the Indian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
dirge sung before by different females, of
the tribe, but as we considered them mere
pieces of formality, we had passed by,
without heeding them. But in this lonely
being, there was an air of deep desolation,
as she lay upon the grave, and a hopeless,
despairing tone, in her low, melodious
voice, that laid bare the recesses of a
withered heart.</p>

<p>We were so much interested in her,
that we had accurately noted her appearance,
and now hurried towards our lodge,
with the intention of finding out her history
from our interpreter—a matter of no
great difficulty, as the history of every individual
of the village is known to all.
We found the half-breed interpreter sitting
in front of the fire, wrapped in his
blanket-coat, with his elbow resting upon
his knee, and his hand supporting his
chin. There was an air of iron gravity
and even sternness in his deep-marked
features that denoted a man not prone to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
yield to womanish emotion. We walked
up to him, and by means of a Frenchman,
(for he spoke no English) inquired the
history of the girl—at the same time narrating
the scene in the prairie.</p>

<p>If it had been in the nature of his face
to wear a more scornful expression than it
usually did, the smile of contempt which
passed over his weather-beaten features,
as we related our story, would have added
to it. For a moment, he seemed surprised—then
added, that she was a squaw,
who resided in the adjoining lodge, and
but a short time before, he had heard her
say to her mother, that as she had nothing
else to do, she believed she would go and
take a <i>bawl</i> over her dead brother’s grave.
He had been killed five years before.</p>

<p>Here was a waste of sympathy. We
were vexed that we had suffered our feelings
to be enlisted in the mock misery of
this girl, who was merely performing a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
customary mummery. There was an expression
of enjoyment in the keen eye of
the half-breed, as he watched the disappointed
expression of our faces. A grim
smile played over his reddish-brown face,
and I believe if he had ever been guilty
of such an action, he would have indulged
in a loud explosion of merriment.</p>

<p>At that moment, the broad voice of our
black cook, announced that the supper
was ready. Discarding both the girl, and
her griefs, from our minds, we seated ourselves
upon the floor, preparatory to commencing
the almost hopeless task, of masticating
a supper of dried buffalo’s flesh,
which had been boiled for only two hours.</p>

<p>When we had finished, it was late in
the evening—the Indians had ceased
moving through the lodge, and wrapping
themselves in their shaggy robes, had
composed their forms upon the clay floor,
for slumber.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span></p>

<p>The servants now busied themselves in
spreading out our bear-skins. This completed,
each retired to his couch, and in a
short time a dead silence reigned throughout
the building.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

</div>

<p class="small center mb2"><i>An Old Warrior.—Indian Dogs.—A Night
Scene.</i></p>

<p>About midnight I awoke; it was intensely
cold, so I rose up and picked my
way over prostrated forms to the fire. An
old Indian was seated by it; his hair was
snowy white, and hung in long locks upon
his shoulders. There were several scars
traced upon his face, and even by that
faint light, the marks of deep wounds were
visible upon his breast. His robe had
fallen from his shoulders, leaving bare the
withered wreck, of what must once have
been an Herculean frame. I did not know
him, nor could he have ranked among their
chiefs. His cheek was resting in the palm
of his hand; his eyes were intently fixed
upon the burning brands which flickered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
up a dying, broken blaze. In his right
hand he held a small piece of wood, with
which he raked together the coals, though
seemingly unconscious of what he was
doing. In front of him lay an uncouth-looking
tomahawk, made of wood, and
across it his otter-skin pouch, and stone
pipe: the symbols of war and peace
thrown together, in a manner which
seemed to denote that to their owner, the
day of strife was past. His look was fixed
upon the brands, but his mind, busied in
its own wanderings, took no note of the
things before his eyes. Could he be meditating
upon the probable results of the
coming of the white men among them?
Could he be sitting there buried in his
own musings, and prophet-like, looking
through the dim vista of futurity? Could
he see his own chivalric race, gradually
withering at the approach of the whites,
and the descendants of those, whose hearts
now beat as free as the eagle’s, crawling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
over the earth, a stigma to their name, and
a curse to themselves? I could not prevent
these thoughts from stealing over
me, as I sat opposite to him, gazing upon
his face, so noble and dignified, even in
its ruin. Upon my first approach, he had
not observed me, but after a short time,
he raised his head, and perceiving me,
reached out his hand, while a friendly
smile played over his face. Then pointing
to his scars, he endeavoured by signs
to narrate to me an account of the different
war expeditions, in which these had
been received. Each wound had a tale of
its own, and each scar told of a different
battle. After spending some time in telling
his story, he lighted his pipe, and first
drawing a few puffs he passed it to me
with the usual word of politeness, (Loovah.)<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a>
I puffed for a few moments, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
returned it to him, he then inhaled a few
draughts of the smoke, and again reached
it to me, and I, after again smoking,
reached it to him. This operation of
smoking and passing it to each other, continued
until the pipe was empty; then
knocking the ashes from its bowl, he raised
himself upon his feet, and taking up his
pouch and tomahawk, drew his buffalo
robe over his head, and left the lodge.
Upon being deserted by my companion, I
looked around upon the muffled forms,
thickly strewed over the clay floor, with
that strange feeling of loneliness, which is
experienced by a person, the only being
awake, among a hundred sleeping forms,
and which is peculiarly strong in a place
where every individual is a stranger, perhaps
an enemy. The lodge was about
sixty feet in diameter, and seen by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
flickering, uncertain light of the fire, it
had a wild appearance. The stern, silent
countenances of the sleeping warriors, as
they reclined with their backs resting
against the pillars which supported the
lodge, reminded me of the eastern tale,
in which a whole city of living beings,
were converted into statues. Their features
were at rest, they were not now the
mirrors which reflected the passions of
their hearts. Even those passions were
slumbering, but still, their heavy lines
were left, with an enduring mark upon
their brows. If those stone-like faces wore
so savage a character, when nature had
thrown her own calm over them, how truly
fearful must they have been in the day of
battle, when every frenzied feeling was at
its height, and every demon passion was
ruling with relentless sway. As to those
who were lying upon the floor, their sleep
was death like—it seemed dreamless.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="label">[H]</a> This is a word more frequently used than any
other in the language. As far as I was able to learn,
it had no particular meaning, but signified—almost
any thing.—In fact it comprises about half of the
language.</p>

</div>

<p>The gaunt Indian dogs were prowling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
stealthily through the building. They
knew that their hour of freedom had come,
and with every leaping blaze of the embers,
I could see them scattered throughout
the lodge. There must have been
nearly fifty of them in full motion, yet
there was not a sound to be heard. They
wound their way through the sleeping Indians,
with the cautious and practised step
of veteran burglars—too well acquainted
with the wakeful habits of their masters,
not to be silent in their doings; and too
much in the habit of stealing, to be able
to resist the temptation to plunder. Occasionally
they paused, and cast a doubting
look upon me, as I sat watching their
movements. They however came to the
conclusion that I was a stranger, and from
my short stay, was not aware that it was
the custom of every Indian, to bestow a
bountiful share of wholesome kicks, upon
every dog that came in his path, as a
punishment for the thefts which he had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
already committed, and as payment in advance
for his future transgressions. While
I was watching their movements I was
startled by a loud whine, which seemed
to proceed from the roof of the lodge.
At that sound there was a general scamper
towards the mouth of the lodge, for they
were certain, that the cry would awaken
the savages, and that flight was their only
safety. I had turned at the moment of
the noise, to ascertain the cause of it.
At the top of the lodge, and about ten feet
from the ground, was a large dog, suspended
by his teeth to a flitch of bacon, which
had been hung up to the rafters to keep it
in safety. Upon coming into the lodge,
the animal had espied this, and mounting
upon a high pile formed by our baggage,
had sprung out at it, as it hung. He had
been successful in his leap, and had buried
his teeth in the meat. But this accomplished,
he could do nothing more—he
was dangling full ten feet from the ground;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
his only supporters were his jaws, which
were fastened into the end of the bacon.
He dared not let loose his hold, and he
was equally certain he could not maintain
it. In this predicament, he raised
his voice, in a long, low, plaintive howl.
Scarce had the sound escaped him, before
a dozen clubs were clattering against his
ribs, and as many clamorous voices raised
in the hue and cry against him. With a
loud yell, relaxing his jaws, he landed
upon the head of an old Indian, who was
dozing beneath, in defiance of the howls
of the dog, and the clamour of his foes.
The animal did not pause, but gaining his
feet, scampered across the building, and
made his escape amidst a shower of missiles
of all descriptions.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

</div>

<p class="small center mb2"><i>Leaving Republican Village.—Prairie between
that and Tappage Village.—Reception by
Tappages.—Departure.—White Cranes.—Black
Chief of the Loups.—Reception.—Chief’s
Lodge.—Soldier Chief’s Feast.</i></p>

<p>The next morning about ten o’clock, we
set off for the village of the Tappage
Pawnees, situated upon the Loup fork of
the Platte, about eleven miles farther up
the river. As we left the town, a crowd
of men, women and children followed us,
in the hope of obtaining presents. The
chief too, escorted us out. He was a
princely man. His head was shorn, excepting
the scalp-lock; his face was free
from paint; a long string of wampum, the
only ornament he ever wore, hung from
his neck; a blue blanket covered one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
shoulder, leaving bare his high, prominent
chest, and the sinewy arm which curbed
the restless movement of his fretted horse.
He had been used to the saddle from childhood,
and now governed his impatient
animal, with the calm controul of a practised
rider.</p>

<p>There is nothing upon which the Indians
pride themselves, more than their
horsemanship. Almost living in the saddle,
they are as much at ease, when mounted,
as when sitting upon the floor of their
own lodge. Many a time, I have seen
two or three village urchins, beset some
unfortunate horse, while quietly dozing
and ruminating, upon the prairie. After
sundry coaxings and efforts, they would
succeed in mounting upon his back, and
then without saddle or bridle, and with a
whoop and yell, that terrified the startled
steed into a full gallop, they would scamper
madly along, clinging to his mane,
and to each other, with a tenacity which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
would have astonished any one but an Indian.</p>

<p>After accompanying us about a mile,
the chief returned, followed by a number
of his warriors. The rest joined our band,
and travelled in company, for the purpose
of witnessing our reception by their rival
village. Our pace was slow, being regulated
by that of the oxen, who toiled painfully
along in the rear.</p>

<p>The prairie was beginning to show the
effects of the autumn frost, and the grass
wore a blighted, withered look. The sun
shone red and lurid through the hazy atmosphere,
denoting what at this season of
the year, is called among the whites, Indian
summer. Not a breeze rustled the
dry grass, or rippled the swift, glassy
waters of the Platte. Every thing was
quiet, except the loud voice of the teamster,
expostulating with his oxen; or an
occasional crack, from the whip of Joseph,
as he urged forward his mules.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span></p>

<p>Now and then, we came upon large
droves of horses, belonging to the Republican
village. They were roving along
the banks of the Platte, in bands of several
hundred, prancing, and capering as
wildly, as if they were still free, upon
their own prairies. Upon our approach,
they raised their heads, and gazed fearlessly
upon us. Two or three of the
largest, then left the herd, and slowly approached.
For a moment they remained
motionless, then with a loud snort, flinging
their heels in the air, they dashed
back to the drove, which sped off, with a
sound like thunder. Occasionally too, we
would pass a small hillock, upon which
an Indian stood motionless, watching our
movements. There is a classic air about
them, when seen at a distance, with their
robes flowing in graceful drapery round
them, their forms drawn fully up, and
their outstretched arms supported by their
long spears. As these scouts thus gazed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
so calm and motionless, I almost imagined
they regarded us with the despair of persons,
who knew that their fall was near,
but that resistance was hopeless.</p>

<p>While we were yet several miles distant
from the village, we observed mounted
Indians, driving before them large droves
of horses, to be ready for service in the
wild ceremony of our reception.</p>

<p>The town of the Tappage Pawnees is
situated upon a broad plain overlooking
the Platte. It is the smallest of all the
Pawnee villages, and contains about a thousand
inhabitants. The most of them were
now poured out upon the prairie, where
we could distinguish them in the distance,
drawn up in a motionless body, waiting
for the signal to dash forward to meet us.</p>

<p>When we approached sufficiently near,
it was given. Once more, we beheld
them coming surge-like upon us, and
changing their course at the very moment
when our ruin seemed inevitable. Again<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
the dizzying evolutions of the troop passed
before us. The wild neighing of the
horses, mingled in confusion—with the
thunder of their hoofs—with the yells
and whoops of the Indians, and the clashing
sound of their bows and tomahawks.
When this was concluded, the ceremony
of presenting horses was performed. Half
an hour brought us to the town, where as
before we found every being on the look
out for our coming, and every preparation
made, to receive us in a manner worthy of
the nation. There is a sameness in Indian
customs and habits, which render description
tedious. Suffice it to say, that we
were received by the chief and his people
with all the kindness and hospitality which
their means afforded.</p>

<p>About ten o’clock on the next morning
we mounted our horses and clattered
through the village on our route for the
town of the Pawnee Loups, situated about
five miles farther up the river. This is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
the wildest of the four villages, owing
perhaps to the savage nature of its chief.</p>

<p>We rode in a straggling string along
the low, irregular prairie. The Otoe
Indians skirted along the bank of the
river. Those of the soldiers, who were
not engaged with the teams, reconnoitered
the different pools of water, in hopes of
coming unawares upon some pensive duck,
who might be dozing upon their surfaces.
Here and there we observed a broken
patch of corn, at the bottom of some
ravine, where the washed earth was of
so soft a texture as to require but little
trouble in cultivation. Occasionally too,
we passed a clump of dwarf trees, closely
grouped together over the brink of a
spring, or run of water. Otherwise the
prairie was bare of forest, and covered
only with long withered grass.</p>

<p>When we had ridden about half the
distance, a number of Otoes came scampering
up, to tell us that there were about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
a dozen white cranes, standing upon a
sand-bar in the Platte. This incident, trivial
as it may seem, created quite an excitement
among the troop. Half a dozen
loaded rifles were handed from the wagons,
and as many soldiers started off followed
by a troop of Indians, with their arrows
ready fitted to their bows, in case the firearms
of the whites should fail. But all
this preparation was useless, for when they
arrived within about three hundred yards
of the bank, one of the birds, who, like
an old man, on a cold day, was standing
with his head closely snugged up against
his breast, and gazing in moralizing mood
upon the swift water, suddenly shot out a
neck, three feet long, and turned a quick
and steady eye upon the approaching hunters.
He gazed a moment, then taking a
step, and slowly raising his wings until
their tips nearly met over his back, he
rose from the earth, as if by mere volition,
uttering a shrill cry which brought after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
him, his startled comrades. As they rose,
a shower of bullets whistled after them,
without disturbing their flight. They
slowly mounted in air floating like a snowflake
over the silver Platte. For a few
moments they lingered over its shining
bosom, as if loth to leave their resting place;
but after wheeling in several widely extended
circles, they soared to an immense
height, and then took a steady course to the
eastward and were lost to the sight.</p>

<p>It was not long before we reached a high
bluff in the prairie, from whence we descried
the village of the Pawnee Loups,
about half a mile distant, but we saw no
signs of preparation to receive us. A
single Indian alone appeared, galloping at
full speed over the prairies. His horse
was of a dark cream colour, fierce, and
powerful. To his bit was attached a scalp,
consisting of the whole upper part of a
human head, the hair of which must have
been full two feet in length, nearly reaching<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
the ground. The horseman proved
to be the Black Chief of the Loups.
When he had come within a few yards of
us, he sprang from his horse, and reached
out the bridle to one of our soldiers to
hold.</p>

<p>His face was far more swarthy than that
of any Indian we had ever seen; but it was
not more dark than the nature of the man.
He was perfectly naked, with the exception
of a pair of leggings of dressed buffalo
hide, worn apparently for the sake of
displaying a profusion of scalp-locks, with
which they were heavily fringed. His
frame was not large, but muscular and
finely formed. His high chest looked as
hard as rock, and the tread of his mocassined
foot, was as firm as iron. His whole
figure was one, which for fine proportion,
and strength, might have served a sculptor,
but his scowling face marred the
beauty of his person. Yet he had his virtues.
He was true to his word, and faithful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
to his friends; but upon his enemies he
let loose every evil passion. The old and
the young; the defenceless mother, and
the harmless child, alike fell beneath his
war-club.</p>

<p>He advanced towards us, and grasped
our hands with a grip which would have
done credit to a vice; then turning round,
he awaited the coming of his warriors,
who had now assembled in the prairie.</p>

<p>Minute after minute passed, but still
there were no signs of approach. The
brow of the Black Chief grew troubled,
and his eye darkened, at the delay. Still
the minutes passed on, and the band remained
motionless. The eye of the chief
was nearly hid beneath his scowling brow,
and he gnawed at his under lip, with a
species of savage calmness. After a moment
he called one of the Pawnees, who
had accompanied us from the last village,
and sent him forward with some instructions
to his warriors. The Indian bounded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
towards the band, but before he had
gone more than one quarter of the distance,
a loud yell burst from them, and
with a heavy, resistless motion, they bore
down upon us. The Indian who had
started, fled back to the party. At the
moment that the cry sounded from the
Pawnee Loups, the chief raised his head,
and sent up a long, shrill scream in answer;
then springing on his horse, he sat
motionless, watching with a keen eye,
their every movement. They had approached
within a hundred yards of the
party, when he again raised his voice in a
loud whoop, and waving his arm, they
separated and rushed to right and left,
round us.</p>

<p>But few horses were presented by this
village, as a party of Sioux Indians had
stolen down upon them but a few weeks
before, and swept off nearly one-third of
the horses belonging to the town. The
chief gave as an excuse, that he had gambled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
away nearly all that he possessed.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a>
This was in fact the truth; for we afterwards
learned that the horse which bore
him, was the only one left, of a large number
that he owned but a short time before.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="label">[I]</a> One of the principal games of the Pawnees, and
the one on which the most gambling is carried on,
is played by means of a small ring and a long javelin.
This ring is about four inches in diameter; and
the object of the player, is to hurl his javelin through
the ring, while it is sent rolling over the ground, with
great speed, by one of his companions in the game.
The javelin is filled with barbs nearly the whole
length, so that when it has once passed partly
through the ring, it cannot slide back. This is done
to ascertain how far it went before it struck the
edges of the ring, and the farther the cast the more
it counts in favour of the one who hurled it. It is
practised by the children, young men, and chiefs.
The first gamble for single arrows—the second for a
bow and quiver—and the last for horses.</p>

</div>

<p>Upon reaching the village we found,
as usual, crowds of women and children,
curious to see us, though they did not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
press round us as in the other villages.
This was owing to the presence of the
chief, who rode by our side, and who, in
fierce tones, ordered the crowd of gazers
to a distance. A concourse had assembled,
too, around the entrance of his lodge;
but upon our approach, they drew back,
and permitted us to pass freely. In the
inside we found a few of the principal
warriors, who alone had been admitted;
the women and the rabble had been prohibited
from entering, and they dared not
disobey orders. There was a feast, as
usual, but we ate little, as we knew what
was to follow. Scarce had we finished,
before a little urchin was in attendance,
to conduct us to the lodge of the Soldier
Chief, the second brave in the village.
We found him seated at a little distance
from the fire, awaiting our arrival. As
we entered, he rose, and presented to
Mr. E—— a large buffalo robe, upon
which was painted a hieroglyphic account<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
of his warlike deeds. After this he seated
himself, and commenced describing the
different fights, and explaining the meaning
of the various symbols.</p>

<p>He was a tall, thin man, with a sharp
muscular face, and a deep-sunk eye, which
glittered in its socket like that of a basilisk.
There was no spare flesh about his
frame, but all was brawn, and sinew. His
look was that of a person formed for the
endurance of great, and continued toil,
and his hardened face showed that he had
weathered exposures of all descriptions.</p>

<p>He apologised to the commissioner for
not having come out with the rest of the
tribe to welcome him—being at bitter enmity
with the chief, and refusing on all
occasions to act in concert with him.</p>

<p>A large bowl of boiled corn was then
placed before us, and each of us furnished
by the Soldier’s wife with a small dipper
of buffalo horn. Having partaken of the
mess as sparingly as the laws of Indian politeness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
would permit, we took our leave.
After we had left the lodge, the Indian
agent who accompanied us related the following
account of a murder which had
occurred but a few months previous, and
which was the origin of the bitter feud
between the Soldier and the Black Chief.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

</div>

<p class="small center mb2"><i>The Shian Captive.</i></p>

<p>During the month of May previous,
business had called Major Dougherty to
the Otoe Agency, on the Missouri. One
morning, while there, a wearied messenger
made his appearance. He had been
sent by a half-breed from the Pawnee
village, with intelligence that the
Loups had taken a Shian woman prisoner,
and intended to burn her at the stake,
in the course of a few days.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_10" href="#FNanchor_10" class="label">[J]</a> The Pawnee Loups are the only Pawnee tribe
that yet retain this custom. They offer their victim
to the Great Star, (the planet Venus.) The prisoner
is, if possible, kept in ignorance of his intended
fate, until led out to die. The sacrifices are generally
offered in the spring of the year, to insure a bountiful
harvest.</p>

</div>

<p>The Agent determined if possible to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
save her. Having made a few hurried
preparations, he set off with five companions.
A journey of three days brought
them to the village. The news of their
visit and the object of it had preceded
them, and they experienced an ungracious
reception. No hand was extended in
friendship; no voice uttered the words of
welcome.</p>

<p>As the little band passed through the village,
the tops of the lodges were crowded
with women and children, and an immense
concourse was drawn up in front of the
dwelling of the chief. They forced their
way through the fierce and sullen mob,
and cleared a passage to the entrance.</p>

<p>Here stood the chief. <i>His</i> welcome,
and <i>his</i> alone was cordial. He ushered
the Agent into his dwelling, nor did he
turn a deaf ear to his request, that the
Shian female might be spared. He told
him, however, that <i>he</i> had no power to
free her, and that all he could do would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
be to assemble a council of the nation, and
lay the matter before <i>them</i>; that he would
use his influence; and that if they could
be prevailed upon, the captive should be
saved. He accordingly despatched messengers
in every direction, to call a council
of the chiefs and braves of the nation,
and they assembled that very night. They
took their seats around the lodge in silence,
with faces which gave but little hope of a
merciful result to their deliberations. In
the centre sat the Agent and his companions;
and near them the Shian captive.
She had been led in passively, and made
no appeal, for she had no hope. It seemed
as if every sense and feeling had been
paralyzed, by the horror of her approaching
fate.</p>

<p>The Agent rose and stated his object to
the meeting. He was a firm man; he had
spent much of his life among the savages;
but it needed all his resolution, and all
his knowledge of the Indian character,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
to effect the desired object. As he spoke
there was no friendly look returned; no
sound of approbation uttered. They listened
with a calm, cold air, and he finished
his address, conscious that he had gained
no point, nor enlisted the friendly feeling
of a single breast, in the whole of the dark
circles which surrounded him.</p>

<p>When he ended, the chief, who during
the whole time had been seated quietly
at the foot of a pillar, rose. He was
in favour of releasing the captive, and
of sending her off with the whites. He
spoke with the wild energy, and vehement
gesticulation customary among the Indians.
During his speech there was a silence—a
portentous silence in the lodge. But
when he had finished, a hundred throats
yelled out cries of anger, and a hundred
eyes gleamed fiercely upon him. It was
not, however, in his nature to yield. Incensed
at the opposition to his will, he
raised his voice, until it even drowned the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
noise of the whole assembly, and swore
by the Great Spirit, that she should be
delivered to the whites; and he dared any
man of the whole assembly, to offer her
the slightest injury.</p>

<p>All quailed before the master spirit, and
bowed to the superior energy of his nature.
One after another they left the lodge, until
the chief, the captive, and the whites
were its sole occupants. In a few moments
the chief went out also. In an hour
he returned, followed by two armed warriors,
whom he stationed in the opposite
part of the lodge, placing the squaw between
them. Upon being asked the reason
of this precaution, he mentioned that
the Soldier Chief, instigated by one of the
Medecin-men of the village, had created
some disturbance, which caused him to
fear for the life of the captive, and that
these men were placed to protect her.
He evaded all farther inquiries, and shortly
after left the lodge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span></p>

<p>The whites stretched themselves upon
their bear-skins, but scarcely closed their
eyes that night. The guards kept watch
on each side of the captive; motionless,
but sleepless. On the following morning,
the horses were saddled in front of the
lodge, and the party having armed themselves,
prepared to mount. The chief
led out the captive, and forcing back the
angry crowd, he placed her upon a horse,
between two of the whites; at the same
time cautioning them to lose no time in
leaving the village. They accordingly
attempted to push forward; but the crowd
hemmed them in so closely, that it was
with difficulty they prevented their horses
from trampling them down. This throng
continued to press round them, until they
reached the lodge of the Soldier Chief.
As they passed it, a bow twanged from
within, and an arrow whizzing through
the air, was buried up to the feather in
the side of the Shian captive. With a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
loud scream, she tossed her arms in the air,
and fell forward upon the neck of the
horse. At the same moment, a loud roar
rose from the multitude; and two Indians
seizing the bridle, jerked the horse onwards.
The crowd opened to let them
pass; but before the whites could follow,
it had again closed. At that moment, the
Agent heard a loud whoop behind him,
and turning, beheld the Black Chief, and
the Soldier, grappled in a desperate conflict,
while the followers of each, stood
by, watching the result. They were
both unarmed, and the issue was to depend
upon their bodily strength alone. They
were well matched, but the Black Chief
had the advantage, for he had a deadly
gripe upon the throat of his opponent.</p>

<p>The Agent knew, however, that whichever
might be victorious, the conflict would
terminate fatally to himself. He therefore
sprang from his horse, and succeeded with
the aid of several chiefs, in dragging them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
apart, and put an end to the contest. He
then turned to look for the captive. She
had been borne off by the crowd, who
were rushing over the prairie with deafening
yells.</p>

<p>Still determined if possible to save her,
he sprang upon his horse and galloped
after them. But he was too late. They
had torn the wretched being to pieces,
smeared themselves with her gore, and
were whirling her head and quivering
limbs in the air.</p>

<p>From that time, there had been a settled
hatred, between the Black Chief and the
Soldier. They spoke not; they entered
not the lodges of each other, and acted no
more in concert than if they had been
two leaders of separate villages.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

</div>

<p class="small center mb2"><i>Exploit of the Black Chief.—Alarm in the
Village.</i></p>

<p>We were sitting late one evening, in the
lodge of the chief, around the fire. There
were about thirty Indians present, some
were lying upon the floor, and others sitting
huddled up, wrapped in their robes,
with their unbending gaze fixed upon our
faces. The servants were spreading our
bear-skins and blankets, preparatory to our
retiring for the night. While thus situated,
the interpreter, after dwelling upon
the desperate nature of our host, related
to us the following anecdote, illustrative of
his character.</p>

<p>About a year previous to this, the Black
Chief had by some means or other fallen
into disgrace with his people. They
shunned him, and refused to admit him to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
their councils, until by some heroic action,
he should wipe off the stain upon his name.
He knew that there was no resource; that
the blood of an enemy alone, would retrieve
his fame. He determined, therefore,
to shed it, in a manner which even
the most desperate of his own tribe, would
not have dreamed of, and which would
strike a salutary terror of his name, into
the hearts of his hostile neighbours.</p>

<p>Early one morning, taking his bow and
quiver, he left his lodge, and started on
foot for the Crow village, about two hundred
miles distant. He set out upon his
journey, without attendants, and singing
his death-song. His tribe watched until
he was out of sight; they knew not where
he was going; he might return soon, in a
day, in a month, and perhaps never.
They knew his desperate character; they
knew that his errand was one of blood;
and they doubted not, that if he returned,
he would bring home trophies, sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
to place him once more, at the head of
their councils.</p>

<p>On the evening of the fourth day, he
reached the Crow village; but waited at
a short distance, concealed in a prairie,
until it was completely dark. He then
entered the village, and passed through its
very centre. Several of the inhabitants
were stirring, but the darkness was so
great that they did not regard him particularly,
and he passed on, undetected.
At length he came to a lodge, a little apart
from the rest, with a horse standing at the
door, tied by a halter of buffalo hair.
Peering over the bear-skin, which hung
before the inner entrance, he beheld two
Indians reclining in front of a fire. A
few feet from them, a squaw was pounding
corn, in a large wooden mortar; and at a
little distance, was a child sleeping on the
floor. The backs of all were turned
towards the warrior, and he hesitated not
a moment how to act. Drawing forth his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
knife with his left hand, and grasping his
tomahawk in his right, he dashed into the
building. With two blows, he clove the
skulls of the men; he sheathed his knife
in the heart of the woman, and dashed out
the brains of the child. Having scalped
his victims he mounted the horse at the
door, and started off. He had gone but a
few paces, before he observed an Indian
making for the lodge. He felt a strong
hankering after his scalp also; but there
were several other Indians at hand, and he
feared detection. Resisting therefore the
powerful temptation, he turned away and
galloped for the prairie. Scarcely had
he got clear of the village, when it rang
with yells and screams; and in a few moments,
he heard the clattering of hoofs,
and the sound of voices in hot pursuit. In
a night chase, however, the pursued has
always the advantage; he has but to dash
forward, while his foes, must either stop
to keep his trace, or follow at random.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
So it was with the Black Chief; and long
before morning his horse had borne him,
far beyond the sound of pursuit.</p>

<p>He reached his village in safety; related
his tale, and displayed his scalps.
They hesitated not a moment, to believe
him, for in recounting his exploits, an Indian
never lies. He was received with
honour; and once more resumed his seat
in the councils of his nation.</p>

<p>This is a picture of Indian warfare—to
steal like an assassin upon an unarmed enemy,
and butcher him without the slightest
chance of resistance. Blood is what he
seeks—no matter whether from the veins
of man or woman—infancy or age. A
scalp is his trophy; and is alike glorious,
whether silvered with age, or torn from
the reeking head of a youthful warrior.
With the savage, a hankering for blood,
is ambition—a relentless fury in shedding
it, renown.</p>

<p>During the whole time of the narration,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
the chief, unconscious that he was the subject
of discourse, sat gazing upon the fire.
His face was as calm and quiet as if no evil
passion had ever harboured in his bosom—as
if his hand had never been stained with
blood, or his ears rung to the wild scream
of the dying.</p>

<p>The tale was scarcely finished, when
we were startled by a loud outcry in the
village. The next moment, the bear-skin
was flung violently back; an armed Indian
rushed into the lodge—shouted out a few
words at the top of his lungs, and as quickly
disappeared. Every savage sprang to
his feet, and rushed to the door, and in
an instant the lodge was deserted.</p>

<p>In a few moments the chief returned.
Never had I seen such a change. His
face which had lately been as unruffled as
that of a sleeping infant, was hideously
distorted. His eyes gleamed like fire,
and his teeth were clenched with rage.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
One of the squaws spoke to him, but he
heeded her not—snatching down from a
shelf his bow and arrows, and catching up
his heavy war-club, he again rushed out.</p>

<p>The tumult grew louder. The interpreter
came in and informed us, that a
party of Sioux Indians had stolen into the
town—opened one of the large wicker
pens, and carried off about fifty Pawnee
horses. They had nearly effected their
retreat, when they were discovered by a
young Indian, who gave the alarm, and
the whole village was now in arms.</p>

<p>On sallying forth, we found every thing
in a state of uproar. Whoops and yells,
mingled with the cries of women, sounded
in every direction. Horsemen were clattering
through the town; band after band
dashed by yelling the war-whoop. The
voices of the leaders were heard above all,
giving orders and cheering their followers
to the pursuit. At length they disappeared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
in the darkness, and the sounds of
their voices died away as they galloped
over the prairie.</p>

<p>In about an hour they returned, and the
chief made his appearance, gloomy and
morose. He had taken no scalps; he had
seen no enemies; no horses had been stolen;
and the whole tumult had been caused
by a young Pawnee, who observing one of
his own tribe busily engaged in collecting
his horses at an unusual hour of the night,
mistook him for an enemy and gave the
alarm.</p>

<p>Nothing farther occurred to disturb
us, and retiring to our couches, we slept
soundly until morning.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

</div>

<p class="small center mb2"><i>Departure from Grand Pawnees.—Delegation.—Death
Song.</i></p>

<p>Two days had elapsed, and we had
again returned to the Grand Pawnee village.
We now prepared for our return to
the white settlements. Nearly two months
had elapsed since the prairie had become
our home, and its wild sons our fellows.
We had lived in the land of the savage;
we had seen, in his real character, the man
of nature. We had seen him in his moments
of joy, and pain; in his moments of
pride and humility; in his paroxysms of
excitement, when urged on by his impetuous
nature; and in his hours of relaxation,
when a calm was upon his burning
bosom, and his passions were asleep. We<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
had seen him, in his home, in the midst of
his family, where the gushes of his heart
were unrestrained; when the feelings of
the husband, and father, and all the kind
impulses of nature had burst the iron fetters
of habit, and resumed their empire.
The illusions thrown around him by the
exaggerated reports of travellers, and the
fictions of poets, had been removed; and
we had beheld him, as he really was; an
untutored, generous, yet savage man. He
had lost much of the romance with which
imagination had clothed him. His faults,
his vices, his crimes, now stood out in
glaring colours, and threw into the shade,
many of his higher qualities. Still with
all his imperfections, we had learned to
admire his chivalrous nature; and to look
upon him while uncontaminated by communion
with the whites, as among the noblest
works of his Maker.</p>

<p>The sun rose cheerily on the morning
of our departure. A crowd had assembled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
in front of the chief’s lodge, to take
a last look at the band of pilgrims, who
had ventured among them.</p>

<p>Many of the most distinguished warriors
stood proudly drawn up, with their
robes muffled round their folded arms,
and their heads thrown back. They
watched us silently, and with countenances
as fixed as marble. The females were in
groups; some in the area in front of the
chief’s abode; and others on the dome-like
tops of the lodges. The voice of childish
glee was ringing among the crowd; and
their merry games were going forward.
Occasionally they would pause to watch
the process of harnessing the horses before
the wagons; and the next instant
would resume their gambols.</p>

<p>A delegation of Pawnees, four from
each village, had been selected to accompany
us to the garrison, in order if possible,
to concert a general peace, among
various tribes. This delegation was joined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
by many volunteers, until at length, nearly
eighty were prepared to accompany us,
to the terra incognita of the white man.</p>

<p>A smile of kindness illumined the grim
face of our savage host, as he bade us farewell.
The horses were saddled; the oxen
were yoked, and had commenced moving
onward. We were preparing to mount,
when our attention was attracted by a low,
and not inharmonious cry, which rose from
the distant part of the village. It came
nearer and nearer, sinking into a long
wailing moan, in which many voices were
united. At length a train of Indians
emerged from behind one of the lodges.
They were dressed in white buffalo robes.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a>
They approached us slowly, still wailing
out their mournful chant; and we recognized<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
them for our party of delegates, and
their fellow travellers.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11" class="label">[K]</a> The white buffalo robe is so called, merely from
one of its sides being whitened with chalk, in
dressing it. The wool is of the same colour as that
of all others, (a dark brown.)</p>

</div>

<p>They were in fact singing their death-song,
as is customary with all the Indian
tribes, before setting out, upon any perilous
expedition. It is merely a recounting
of their different exploits in battle, and
winds up, by taking leave of their friends
and fellow townsmen. Although it is sung
with an air of vast resignation, by all;
and although you would think, that after
it, the songster, would go to the grave,
“like a lamb to the slaughter;” yet from
all that I could ever learn, there are no
people that have a greater antipathy to
dying, than the savages, or take more
trouble to keep out of harm’s way.</p>

<p>The melancholy dirge swelled loudly as
the long train moved past us; but it gradually
became fainter, and fainter, as they
wound their way among the distant lodges,
and disappeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span></p>

<p>In a few moments, we were galloping
over the prairie, to overtake some of the
party who had preceded us. A train of
Indians followed us, and the tops of the
lodges were crowded.</p>

<p>After travelling a mile, we at last crossed
the top of a ridge, and lost sight of the
town.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

</div>

<p class="small center mb2"><i>Storm.—Dog Feast.</i></p>

<p>A heavy storm of mingled snow and
rain set in, on the day after our departure
from the Pawnee village.</p>

<p>If there is any thing truly comfortless,
it is a camp upon a rainy day. Every
thing combined to add to its gloomy character.
The fly of the tent, which might
have afforded us protection, had been torn
to tatters; and the roof of our canvas
house, settled down into a bag. Through
this a steady stream of water distilled,
upon the centre of a board, which we had
honoured with the appellation of a breakfast
table. The blankets were rolled up,
and piled in the middle of the tent, covered
by a large bear-skin. This was nearly
saturated with the drizzling moisture. A
large pile of green logs, heaped up in front<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
of the tent, refused to burn, but yielded a
bountiful supply of smoke, which the
wind occasionally wafted in clouds into our
canvas habitation.</p>

<p>The thorough drenching which they
had received, seemed to have soaked all
pride and dignity, out of our Indian companions.
They crouched like wet poultry
round the fire, shutting their eyes,
and holding their breath, determined to
receive some of its warmth, in defiance of
the clouds of smoke which it threw into
their faces. Here and there, were small
groups squatting out in the prairie; each
man was huddled up into a knot, with the
rain pouring in streams down his shaggy
robe, and dripping off into the grass. The
paint was drenched from his face, and his
whole demeanour so utterly changed, that
it was almost impossible to recognize the
proud, haughty warrior, in the dripping,
bedraggled being, then crouching in the
grass, beneath the pelting storm. Once or
twice, some poor, half-drowned fellow,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
with a desperate attempt at jovialty,
struck up a song, with a come-let’s-be-jolly
kind of an air, which was intended
to set the weather and fortune at defiance;
but it was a failure. At the commencement
one or two voices struck in with valorous
spirit, but finding that they were
not supported, they gradually sunk into
silence, leaving the person who had commenced
the strain, to finish it as well as he
might.</p>

<p>Drip—drip—drip—pattered the rain
into a tin bucket, placed in the tent to
receive it. At length a large puddle
which had collected in the rear, overflowed
its banks, and stole in a small rivulet
through the centre of the tent. A smothered
oath from one of the party, who was
seated in the very track of the water, announced
its intrusion. Several of the soldiers
were then sent out, with pails and
shovels, and in a short time succeeded in
draining a part of the pond, and digging a
different outlet for its waters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span></p>

<p>Just then the yelping of a cur was
heard at a little distance, in a clump of
bushes, which the Wild Horse had chosen
for his residence.</p>

<p>“So! the dog too is a sufferer on account
of the inclemency of the weather.
No doubt the Wild Horse is completely
drenched, and in a terrible fume.”</p>

<p>Another hour passed, but still the rain
continued. Just then the entrance of the
tent was darkened, and the Wild Horse
entered. He held in his hand a large
wooden bowl, filled with boiled flesh,
which he placed smoking before us. We
were informed that it was dog flesh, and
invited to try it. The soldiers had also
received a share, but without being told
what it was. “What is it,” said one,
taking up a small morsel, and holding it
to his nose, “is it venison?”</p>

<p>“It tastes odd,” said another, biting in
two a large piece. Several of them then
commenced an attack upon the contents of
their bowl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t exactly <i>know</i> what animal
this belongs to,” said one of them, who
was eating heartily; “and to tell the
truth, I don’t altogether like the <i>strangeish</i>
taste, there is about it.”</p>

<p>“Poh! what should it be,” repeated
another, “but venison? and mighty tender
too. I wish there was more of it;
fresh meat don’t come every day upon
these prairies, for the deer are getting
powerful shy.”</p>

<p>Just then the canvas opening of the
tent was pulled back, and the iron face of
the interpreter was thrust in to say, that
the Wild Horse wished to know, if the
commissioner was pleased with the <i>dog’s</i>
flesh. The soldiers overheard it, and in
an instant the dish was hurled from the
fire, and the gourmands made for the
water, writhing and twisting their faces,
as if they had been stricken by St. Vitus.
The Wild Horse gazed upon them with
amazement, mingled with anger; but when
the interpreter explained the cause of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
tumult, his displeasure vanished, and a
grim smile lighted up his hard, weather-beaten
face. Then turning to his wife,
(for he was attended by his better half)
he called for a fresh supply of the viand,
and collecting round him a group of the
vagabond-looking beings, who were nestling
in the grass, they soon left little else
but clean bones in the bowl.</p>

<p>We lay for a whole day upon the banks
of the Platte river, but towards sunset a
bright blue streak appeared in the west,
and the dark misty clouds began to drive
off towards the south. The sun at length
showed itself upon the distant hills, and
before it had completely sunk in the west,
the sky was as pure and cloudless as in
one of the happy days of June. This was
hailed with joy by the whole band, both
Indians and whites, and preparations were
made for an early start on the following
morning.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

</div>

<p class="small center mb2"><i>Deer Hunt.—Encampment.—Indian Night
Fires.—Lost Horses.—Doctor’s Mule.</i></p>

<p>On the third morning after leaving the
village, I started out to hunt on foot in
company with three Indians: two Otoes,
who had borrowed rifles from the soldiers,
and a Pawnee. The party, and the train
of accompanying delegates, were journeying
in a long line, over the prairie,
at some miles distance. We had
hunted for several hours, up and down
the deep ravines, which intersected the
prairie. My two companions had become
separated from me; but a sturdy
Pawnee lingered with me, and trudged
lustily along at my heels, with the hope
of coming in for a share of any game
that I should kill during the day. We<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
travelled up one ravine, and down another,
but nothing was to be found.</p>

<p>“Ugh!” burst from the lips of the Pawnee.
I looked round; he was crouching
flat to the ground, and made signs to me
to get my rifle in readiness. Vague suspicions
of danger flashed across my mind;
we had heard that there was a band of
Sioux Indians lurking round our party.
Could we have come unawares upon them?
These ideas flashed momentarily upon me,
but they as quickly subsided, and cocking
my gun, I stole cautiously towards him.
He was crouching in some bushes, near
the jagged top of a small ridge, which
looked down into a deep ravine. As I
approached him, he shrank still closer into
his hiding place, and made signs to me to
pass to the top of the ridge. I crept up
slowly, and peered above its level; at the
instant, I caught sight of an Indian, as
he squatted quickly behind a bush. My
fears seemed realized. We had fallen into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
the snare! I looked back towards the
Pawnee; he was still maintaining his position,
and keenly watching my movements.
As he caught my eye he urged me by his
gestures to fire: I hesitated. At that instant
the dark form in front of me, rose
slowly up from behind the bush; and I
recognised the stern, proud features of one
of my Otoe companions. The next moment,
I caught sight of a large buck lying
lazily beneath the shade of a bush. The
mystery was explained in an instant. The
Pawnee had seen the animal; and it was
the deer, and not the Indian, whom he
wished to be shot. As I rose to fire the
Otoe again crouched behind the bush; the
bullet missed, and the beast leaping up,
sprang towards the spot where his foe lay
hid. He had scarcely taken three leaps,
before a shot whistled from a clump of
bushes, at some distance, and in a different
quarter. The deer changed his course,
and springing forward, made for the opposite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
side of the ravine. He dashed
through the bushes, and bounded like
lightning up the ragged steep. At that
moment the Otoe, who had first secreted
himself, had a fair view of him; he must
have been about a hundred yards distant,
and was dashing furiously up the craggy
hill. The Indian fired, and the deer fell on
one knee, but regained his feet. In front
of him, was a steep bank, covered with
shrubbery. He made a desperate effort
to gain it, but failed; and rolled headlong
down, until he splashed in the brook at
the bottom. A loud whoop burst from
the three Indians, and the two youngest
sprang forward to the spot; while the
third, who was a cautious old fellow, stopped
to reload his rifle.</p>

<p>When they arrived at the place where
the buck had fallen, they found that he
was not dead, neither was his wound mortal;
one of his fore legs was shivered by
the bullet, but he had gained his feet, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
now stood at bay. His head was bent to
the ground, and he dashed his antlers furiously
in every direction; his eyes flared
with a wild, menacing expression; and
the white foam slavered from his mouth.
The Indians made several attempts to
thrust their knives into him, but were
as often balked by his fiercely-brandished
antlers. They hovered around him like
wolves; now threatening him in one quarter;
now in another; but his horns ever
met them. They then both attacked him
at once, and succeeded in inflicting a slight
wound. It served only to increase his
fury; he leaped towards them, with a
ferocity that caused them in turn to take
to flight. Just then, the Indian who
had remained behind to load his rifle,
came up. The buck faced towards him
and again brandished his antlers; but a
bullet hurled him to the ground, and the
next moment a tomahawk was buried between
his eyes. A sharp convulsive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
shudder passed over his frame, he made
a desperate effort to gain his feet, but in
vain, a second shudder concluded his
mortal struggle, and falling over upon his
side, he expired.</p>

<p>An Indian is a quick butcher, and not
more than ten minutes had elapsed, before
the animal was skinned, and cut up. Each
of us took a quarter upon our backs and
set off for the encampment; which we
reached about an hour after night fall.</p>

<p>The party had encamped in a small isolated
grove. It was completely clear of
underwood, except here and there a tall
bush; and there was not another tree in
sight. A spring gushed out at the foot of
a hill at a short distance, and flowed in a
pure but scanty stream through the grove.</p>

<p>When we came in we found that the Indians
had divided into squads, and that
every ten or a dozen had kindled their
own night fires. All the arrangements,
preparatory to remaining quiet, were not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
yet completed. The soldiers were felling
dead trees, for fuel. Joseph was busily
employed, in hobbling and swearing at his
mules; while Mordecai with the air of a
connoiseur, stood by, assisting him with
his advice.</p>

<p>Some of the Pawnees, and Otoes, were
scattered through the grove in search of
fuel. Some breaking dead limbs from off
the trees, and others collecting what was
already strewed upon the ground. Two
or three were erecting shantees to keep off
the dews of the night. And several
young Otoes were employed in weaving a
shed of boughs, to shelter the wife of the
Iotan, who had been unwell for several
days past; and whose disease always grew
worse towards evening, when she would
have been obliged to assist in the labour,
if she had been in good health.</p>

<p>In the course of an hour, the Indians
completed their arrangements, and kindled
a string of fires along the dry bed of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
a stream. As I had never seen them when
encamped, except upon the Platte, where
all vivacity had been soaked out of them.
I strolled among the different groups.
They were all in high glee. I came to the
fire, occupied by the Wild Horse’s family
and a few of his dependants. The old
warrior was in the keen enjoyment of some
witticism just uttered by a little shrivelled
fellow, a hanger on, who was evidently
trying to make himself agreeable; that he
might be invited to partake of a racoon
that was cooking over the fire, under the
superintendence of the squaw of his host.
The Wild Horse made room for me by his
side, so I seated myself, nor was I permitted
to leave until I had partaken of his
viands. From his fire I went to that of
the Long Hair, who was huddled up, with
his whole soul apparently engaged, in roasting
a small piece of venison, upon the point
of a green stick. He looked up for a moment,
and then turned his attention to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
roasting meat. I soon left him and strolled
off to the fire of the Otoes. Here I found
the Doctor very cosily seated between the
Iotan, and his wife, prescribing for <i>her</i>,
and taking care of <i>himself</i>, by occasionally
cutting a rib from a large piece of venison
standing in front of the fire, impaled upon
a stake of green wood.</p>

<p>Early the next morning the tents were
struck, when Mordecai made his appearance
with a very lugubrious face, informing
us that two horses had disappeared, and
that the mule belonging to the Doctor was
also missing. The Doctor was in a fever.
He ran down to the place where the animals
pastured; he examined the bushes,
and beat through all the long grass; but his
mule, Kitty Keero, was not to be found.
He then seated himself upon the stump of
a tree, and thrusting his hands in his
breeches-pockets, shouted the name of his
mule at the top of his lungs; but no Kitty
Keero answered him. At last the Interpreter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
pointed to a savage-looking Pawnee,
leaning against a tree, with his hair
matted and twisted in every direction, and
a few long elf locks reaching down to his
naked waist. He advised the Commissioner
to send him in search of the horses;
as he was a first rate fellow to track a hoof.
A blanket was accordingly promised the
Indian in case of success, and after hovering
around the grove for a short time, in
search of the hoof mark, he hit upon it,
and started off like a hound.</p>

<p>In an hour he returned, bringing with
him the vagrant animals. Kitty Keero
gave utterance to a long apologetic bray,
as she entered the grove. This was well
received by her master, who was so much
overjoyed at once more seeing her, that
two or three reproachful repetitions of her
name, were all the chidings she received.</p>

<p>The wagons then drove out of the grove,
followed by the Indians; the rear being
brought up by the horsemen. In front of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
them rode the Doctor mounted upon Kitty;
and as they jogged slowly along, I could
not help thinking, that they would have
formed no inapt illustration of Sancho
Panza and his beloved Dapple.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

</div>

<p class="small center mb2"><i>Elk Chase.—Wandering from Party.—Herd
of Elk.—Night Camp.—Hill of Bones.—Racoon.—Indian.—Return
to Party.—Wild
Horse.</i></p>

<p>On the morning of the fifth day of
our journey, an Otoe Indian, who was on
the look-out, came running to us with the
intelligence of a large <i>gang</i> of elk. All
was excitement. The soldiers snatched
their yagers; the Otoes their rifles; the
Pawnees strung their bows, drew their
arrows from their quivers, and all hurried
after the Indian guide, over the prairie
which had been burnt before us. In ten
minutes they reached the top of a hill,
looking down into a deep ravine, about
three hundred yards distant. It was
thronged with elk. Some were gamboling
about; some resting amid the high<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
luxuriant grass, which here had escaped
the fire. Others browzing upon the foliage
of the vines, which hung in long and
graceful festoons from the dwarf bushes;
and some were slaking their thirst at a
limpid brook. But even in these, their
moments of greatest security, their instinctive
vigilance was not at rest. For
while most of the herd were frolicking,
several, who from their enormous size,
and the unwieldly length of their antlers,
appeared to be the oldest in the gang, had
stationed themselves as sentinels, on jutting
rocks in the elevated banks, which commanded
an extensive view. There they
stood on the look-out, their heads high in
the air, their nostrils expanded to catch
the tainted breeze.</p>

<p>Scarcely had our band paused on the
top of the hill, before the eyes of the
watchful sentinels were turned upon them,
and a loud snort gave the signal for a general
flight. The bushes and shrubs, snapped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
and crashed beneath their rush, as
they rolled together in a heavy mass.
Their branching antlers tore through the
wild vines; and the whole herd dashed
across the ravine and thundered up the
opposite steep. Large stones and fragments
of rock, gave way beneath the tread
of the leaders, and fell bounding among
the hindmost. Those in front broke off
large masses of sandy soil from the edge of
the banks, and losing their footing, were
whirled back among their companions.
Notwithstanding the confusion, however,
half a minute had not elapsed, before the
whole herd had surmounted the steep, and
were flying over the prairie, with the
swiftness of a whirlwind.</p>

<p>“No elk meat to-day,” said Rash, (one
of the soldiers,) leaning on the end of his
yager, and watching the herd as they
swept behind a distant skirt of trees.</p>

<p>“Ugh!” ejaculated an Otoe, in answer.</p>

<p>“Ugh!” ejaculated half a dozen Pawnees,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
unstringing their bows, and turning
off towards the camp.</p>

<p>“Ugh! nin-gah om-pah,” (no elk) said
Hah-che-kah-sug-hah, shouldering his rifle
and preparing to continue his journey.</p>

<p>I had been in the habit of hunting in
company with this Indian, and when he
started forward, instead of returning to the
camp with the rest, I followed him. The
deer were abundant in this section of the
country, and our object was game. We
commenced a keen search in the hollows,
but for a long time were unsuccessful. At
last the guttural “ugh!” from the Indian,
informed me that he saw something: and
the next moment he pointed out a large
buck, reclining in a distant hollow. He
immediately made for it, while I seated
myself in the grass, to watch his success.
After stealing along several hollows, and
keeping among the tall grass, he at last
came upon the animal and fired. The buck
started up, staggered a few paces, then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
scoured away over the top of the hill. The
Indian, after pausing to reload, followed,
and also disappeared. I waited in hopes
of hearing the <i>whoop!</i> which usually followed
a successful shot; but all was silent;
so I sauntered slowly along, expecting him
to return. Nearly half an hour had elapsed,
when I caught sight of him, standing
upon the top of a high peak, at several
miles’ distance. Supposing that he had
been led off by game, I no longer delayed
for him, but struck forward, selecting a
route for myself. I had been in the habit
of leaving the party at sunrise, previously
ascertaining the direction which they intended
to take; then coming upon their
trail during the day, by following it I
had always reached the camp by nightfall.
From never failing in this, I had
grown self-confident, and this morning, I
had not even inquired their intended
course.</p>

<p>I travelled for many hours; following<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
the hollows, and beating the tall grass, in
hopes of starting a deer; but with the exception
of a few grouse, I met with nothing.
I had continued thus unsuccessful till afternoon,
and was sauntering along a high
ridge, looking round to see if I could perceive
any trace of the party, when suddenly
turning my head, I caught sight of
a number of objects, stringing slowly along
the top of a ridge. At first I was surprised;
for I mistook them for a train of
pack-horses; but the next moment undeceived
me, and I discovered that I had
come unaware, upon a herd of elk. There
were about a dozen of them. They were
as quick-sighted as myself; for at the very
moment that my eye rested upon them,
they also detected me. They halted and
snuffed the air; but I was too far off to
taint it. So they turned away, and slowly
loitered on. I immediately made for a
thicket of brushwood, and beneath this
shelter, rushed swiftly towards them. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
had not gone far, however, when, upon
rounding a small point of bushes, I came
directly upon another herd. There must
have been more than a hundred in it.
Many were lying upon the ground; some
were gamboling and frisking; two or three
were butting each other with their horns;
and several wary old fellows were stationed
round as sentinels. I was within a hundred
yards of them, so I fired at a full-grown
buck. The bullet struck one of his
fore legs, and he fell. In an instant the
whole herd were on their feet, and huddling
together like frightened sheep, they
fled over the hills.</p>

<p>I sprang from my hiding place, and
drawing my knife, ran towards the wounded
animal; but before I could reach him,
he gained his feet, and hobbled off, at a
rate which kept me at the full stretch of
my speed. I then stopped to reload my
rifle, and followed expecting every moment
to see him drop. He led me a long<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
chase, over hill and dale, and across runs
of water; until I gave out; and seating
myself, saw him hobble out of sight.</p>

<p>It was now time to look out for the party;
a thing which I had totally forgotten, in
the heat of the chase; nor had I taken any
note of the course I was pursuing; so that
when my race was ended, I was completely
bewildered. I was within a short distance
of a well-wooded stream, and I suspected
that the party would encamp, somewhere
upon its banks. I knew too, that they
must be to the westward of me, so I followed
the course of the river.</p>

<p>I travelled till sunset, examining every
ridge in the prairie; every bend in the
thicket; but there was no human being to
be seen, nor a trail, or foot print, on the
burnt sod, except the hoof marks, where
the herd of elk had passed. I then clambered
to the top of a high-peaked hill,
which overlooked the prairie for miles;
but all was deserted. I determined, then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
to encamp for the night, in the neighbouring
piece of wood, and in the morning to
renew my search. At the same time, resolving
like most persons who are in trouble,
that if I got safely out of this scrape,
I would take better care when next I
hunted alone. I went down into the woods
and built a fire. The night was cold, and
bleak. There was no grass to make a bed;
the wolves howled incessantly; and to
judge from their snarling, and yelping at
the foot of a tree, a little distance off, I
imagined, that they had pursued some
animal, which had taken refuge in its
branches. The night passed away drearily,
and with a joyous feeling, I once
more saw the east streaked with the light
of dawn.</p>

<p>Before the day had fairly broken, I left
the grove, and pursued my course to the
westward, until I again came to a ridge in
the prairie. This I ascended and looked
in every direction; but could see nothing.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
I raised my voice and gave an Indian
hunting whoop, which might have been
heard for a mile. The woods echoed it;
but there was no other answer. I wished
to discharge my rifle, in hopes that it
might reach the ears of the party; but I
had only a single charge of powder, left
in my horn; and if I should be obliged to
journey to the settlements alone, I thought
that this would be too precious to be
wasted. So in silence, and with drooping
spirits, I continued my journey along the
line of timber. The sun rose, and gradually
ascended in the heavens. A vague
doubt began to steal across my mind; that
I had, perhaps, crossed the trail, in the
obscurity of the morning twilight; for I
was now much farther to the west, than I
thought it possible, the party could have
gone. About a mile in front of me a long
arm of timber jutted out into the prairie.
I made for it, determining if I did not
then come upon their trail, that I would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
retrace my steps and carefully examine
that portion which I had crossed before
daybreak. I reached the timber; but
saw no track. I again whooped; but as
before, the echoing forests alone answered
me; and with a sensation of utter loneliness,
I turned round and retraced my
steps. It was near mid-day when I reached
my last encamping place. I had carefully
noted every mark upon the black
sod; I saw my own foot-prints, where I
had struck out into the prairie in the
morning; but nothing else. I then kept
on for an hour longer, but my mind was
constantly vascillating—whether to follow
my own foot-prints until they guided me
to the camping ground where I had left
the party on the day previous, or to keep
on to the eastward until I should reach
the Missouri; or once more to return
over the ground which I had just passed.</p>

<p>I remember well the spot where I paused
to settle my purpose. It was a high<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
swell, which commanded a view over miles
of prairie, and even overlooked the top of
the lofty trees in the thicket. It was
strewed with bones. For several hundred
yards, the whole hill was literally covered
with them. It looked like some deserted
charnel; and I recollect even in the midst
of my perplexity, taking up one and examining
it—wondering whether it belonged
to man or beast. The place might
have been the scene of a battle; for the
bones were so small that they could scarcely
be those of animals. There were no
skulls, either of man or brutes, to solve
the mystery; and even the bones were
covered with a greenish mould, from many
years’ exposure.</p>

<p>After some consideration, I resolved to
retrace my steps, and accordingly turned
down the hill, and once more proceeded
on my journey. I now was growing hungry,
and for once felt the miseries of a
keen appetite. In the midst of these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
cogitations, I caught sight of the head
of a racoon, who was reconnoitering me
from behind the stump of a tree; I shot
him, and skinned him; and kindling a
fire, cooked part of him on the spot. The
cinders from my fire, caught in a small
patch of dry grass, which had escaped
the general burning of the prairie; and in
a moment it was in a blaze—filling the air
with a cloud of black smoke. When I
finished my meal, I slung the residue of
my prize upon my back, and struck out
into the prairie. I had scarcely done so
before I caught sight of an Indian, standing
upon the top of a ridge at some distance.
In a moment after he perceived
me, and waved his blanket over his head,
to attract my attention. I raised the Otoe
hunting-whoop, and his shout, faint, from
the distance, answered me. I then started
for the hill, and the Indian, seating himself,
waited till I came up. He was one
of the Otoes who accompanied us. His<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
Indian name I do not recollect; but when
translated it signified, “<i>the man that
drags his heels</i>.” It was given him on
account of a shuffling gait, which it was
said that he possessed, but which I could
never discover.</p>

<p>We started together, and about a mile
beyond the arm of timber where I had
turned back in the morning, we came
upon the trail of the party.</p>

<p>Night closed in upon us, long before
we reached their camping ground. I was
nearly exhausted; the light racoon, which
I carried upon my back, seemed to grow
almost as heavy as a deer. My thirst
grew intense; I stopped to drink at
every pool; and kept constantly breaking
off the tops of the rosin weed, and
chewing its pitchy sap to keep my mouth
moist. Still the Indian kept on with unwearied
steps, sometimes pausing to listen
as a cry sounded through the night air,
or turning to point out the light of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
prairie on fire at a distance. He did not
slacken his pace, until with a deep ugh!
he pointed out to me the night-fires of our
party, glimmering in a thick grove, on
the borders of a brawling stream.</p>

<p>A loud shout, followed by a genuine
Indian yell, burst from the lips of the
doctor, when he first caught sight of me.
This was followed by a hearty shake of the
hand, and warm congratulations from the
commissioner, and the whole party.</p>

<p>I was afterwards informed, that the
Indian who discovered me, had crossed
my track on the day previous; and, upon
being told that I had not made my appearance,
he had been induced by the promise
of a blanket to set out in search of me.</p>

<p>I had not been long seated before our
fire, when the Wild Horse, dressed in a
pair of white corduroy pantaloons, with
the rest of his body naked, came stalking
up to shake hands with me. His object
evidently was to display this new article<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
of dress; which had been presented to
him by the doctor. Although highly delighted,
he walked in them, as if in fetters;
for though the doctor had a rotundity
of abdomen, which completely out-measured
that of the Indian, yet the other
far exceeded him in the size and length
of his lower extremities; and the garment
sat so tight to his legs, that at a little distance
he had the appearance of having
been white-washed. He kept about us
during the whole evening. I imagine, however,
that in this short space of time he
grew completely tired of his new garb,
for the next morning, I saw his son scampering
through the bushes, dressed in the
same pair of breeches—though they were
as much too large for him, as they were
too small for his father. He, too, soon
wearied of them; and after having once
or twice tripped up his own heels in wearing
them, he abandoned them to the wife
of the Wild Horse, who, I believe, from
that period “wore the breeches.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

</div>

<p class="small center mb2"><i>The False Alarm.</i></p>

<p>The sun was glowing with a mellow
warmth, upon the prairie; when our train,
slowly ascended one of the black, undulating
swells, which traverse the whole face
of the country. At our feet, lay a great
prairie, intersected by a waving thread of
timber, which extended for many miles,
and was now tinted with the bright and
variegated hues of autumn.</p>

<p>The Pawnees stood for a moment upon
the top, casting their eyes about them. A
shriek rang through the air; so wild, and
shrill, that it caused even the most stern
to start convulsively, and clutch their
bows, while the deep guttural “Ugh” burst
from every chest, as they turned towards
the Indian, who sent up the cry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span></p>

<p>He was standing a little in advance of
the party; his slender but muscular frame,
bent slightly forward; his form resting
firmly upon one foot, while the ball of the
other alone touched the ground, as if he
had been arrested, in the act of stepping
forward. His nostrils were expanded;
his teeth slightly bared; his eyes intently
fixed in the direction indicated by the extended
forefinger of his outstretched arm.
The eyes of the whole dusky troop were
instantly turned in that direction. They
gazed for an instant, and then the prairie
sounded with their shrill, appalling yells.</p>

<p>At the foot of the hills, at the distance
of about five hundred yards, a small band
of Indians were emerging from a wood;
their white blankets and glittering gun-barrels,
contrasting strongly with the
dusky forms, and savage weapons, of our
Pawnee companions. For a short space,
there was silence, and then arose the second
wild shout of the Pawnees, while the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
hated name of “Konza! Konza! Konza!”
burst in a howl from every lip.</p>

<p>The little band in the glen, sent up an
answering shout, which though it sounded
less loudly, on account of the smallness
of their numbers, and the distance which
intervened, was still replete with defiance.
As they raised their yell, they snatched
their rifles from their shoulders, and prepared
for the encounter.</p>

<p>Just then a loud whoop was heard, and
Wild Horse came rushing up the hill-side
which we had just ascended. His long
hair streamed in the wind. In his hand,
he grasped his bow, and about a dozen arrows.
He had heard the answering cry
of the Konza, and had snuffed a fight in
the wind, with the keen relish of a veteran
warrior. His small black eye glittered
with joy, as he looked down upon the
handful, who had dared to send up a note
of defiance. He uttered a wild, exulting
laugh, and shaking his war-club with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
fierce motion, towards the distant foes, he
raised a war-whoop, and waved his men
onward.</p>

<p>And now the loud voice of the Iotan
chief rose amid the din, calling away his
band of Otoes, and summoning them to the
top of a neighbouring hill. He was at
peace with the Konzas, and had nothing
to do in the present strife; it was all
the same to him which gained the day; so
he coolly drew off his men, and waited to
see the result. On an eminence at a short
distance, stood the Apollo-like form, and
snarling, tiger face of the Long Hair. His
robe was thrown over his left arm, while
his right, grasping his bow, waved his
warriors fiercely forward.</p>

<p>For a very short space, the cloud of Indians
hung upon the hill, and then, with
one wild cry they swept down upon the
devoted band. There was no order of battle;
each rushed forward goaded by his own
impulses. They raised no farther shout;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
every feeling seemed now absorbed in
the deep, burning thirst for blood. Their
adversaries displayed equal alacrity. A
loud, fierce shout had answered the war-cry
of the Pawnees; then all was silent;
they leaped forward, prepared to give
cold lead in answer to the feathered
shafts of their ruder foes. As they advanced
they separated, and extended their
front, to prevent their being outflanked.
They had now reached within about two
hundred yards of each other, when a hesitation
was visible in the Pawnee band.
They moved slower and slower. One or
two stopped, and gazed steadily at their
approaching enemies: then they collected
in groups, and seemed to consult. Even
the Wild Horse, a savage who had revelled
in blood from his infancy, dropped his
uplifted war-club, and pausing, leaned
upon his bow. The Long Hair drew up
his haughty form, and, swinging upon his
back his quiver, which had before hung<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
in front, folded his arms, and appeared to
wait passively for the approach of the opposite
band.</p>

<p>A grim smile of scorn had curled the
lip of the old Iotan chief, when he first
beheld the hesitation in the Pawnee ranks.
For, like the chiefs of most of the neighbouring
tribes, though he feared the immense
hordes which belonged to that nation,
yet he most heartily despised every
individual of the four villages. There
was an apparent acknowledgment of inferiority
in this numerous band, thus hesitating
to attack the handful, who challenged
them to the conflict, which pleased the
veteran chief; for in war, his own nation
and the Konza, had always been looked
upon as equals.</p>

<p>In a moment, however, a like hesitation
was observed in the ranks of the foe. They
drew up and shouldered their rifles, and
then moved frankly forward to meet the
Pawnee warriors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span></p>

<p>The old chief was perplexed. He held
his hand anxiously over his eyes, to penetrate
the mystery. Suddenly a new light
seemed to flash over his countenance.
Waving his hand in the air, he shouted the
name of his own tribe, and rushed down
the hill, followed by his band. It was a
party of Otoes, instead of Konzas, and the
recognition which had fortunately taken
place, had prevented the effusion of blood,
which otherwise would have followed.</p>

<p>The parties now drew off, keeping
coldly aloof, and eyeing each other with
those proud and haughty glances, which
are apt to pass between rival people even
when friendly.</p>

<p>The Iotan conversed a short time with a
tall, thin Indian, who appeared to have
command of the hunting party, and, after
leaving with him, a worn-out horse which
he had brought from the Pawnee village,
resumed his journey, in which he was followed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
by the whites, and the long train of
disappointed Pawnees.</p>

<p>For a short time, the Otoes watched
the movements of the party, then turning
off, they crossed the prairie, and disappeared
in a piece of forest.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

</div>

<p class="small center mb2"><i>Elk Chase.—Indian Sagacity.—Indian Camp.</i></p>

<p>On the following day we were traversing
a valley between two black prairie
hills, when the crack of a rifle sounded
from a distant hollow, and was followed
by a loud shout. The Indians stopped
short, and listened, but the shout was not
repeated. At length a young Pawnee,
impatient, sprang upon a horse and galloped
over a hill, beyond which the shout
had arisen. As he disappeared over its
top, a second shout was heard. After the
lapse of a few moments a loud whoop rose
from the same quarter, and suddenly a
powerful buck elk, with branching antlers,
and enormous tynes, dashed with mad
leaps to the summit of the hill. He stopped
short at the sight of our band and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
glared wildly around. He was wounded
in the shoulder, and the Pawnee was in
hot pursuit. Casting a quick glance round
at his foe, and throwing back his head, he
bounded along the ridge. The wound in
his shoulder, lessened his speed. The
Pawnee plied his lash. The heavy hoofs
of his horse, struck with a jarring sound
upon the burnt prairie; and a whirl of
black ashes was raised in a light cloud
around him. His long hair streamed in
the air, and his dark, heavy robe, fluttered
from his shoulders, as he dashed
forward. A great interest in the result
was evinced. The Pawnees were anxious
that their hunter should acquit himself
well, in the presence of a foreign tribe,
who watched his movements with a jealous
eye. The Otoes lost their usual cold character,
in the earnest interest, excited by
the headlong chase; and the Indian hunter
who had wounded the elk, stood upon the
top of the hill, leaning upon the muzzle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
of his rifle, and watching the success of
his ally.</p>

<p>The elk reached the end of the ridge,
and sprang down its sloping declivity.
The Pawnee horseman followed. In a
moment after the elk was seen bounding
up an opposite ridge, and leaping along its
verge. His pursuer pressed on, about fifty
yards in the rear. Here the chase was
again in full sight, and continued so for
a few moments. The elk was growing
weaker and weaker. He came to the end
of a ridge which was cragged and almost
perpendicular. He paused for a moment
on the brink; looked down the steep;
cast a glance behind; then gathering his
feet he made a desperate bound down the
rugged bank, and in a moment’s time
dashed up to the top of a succeeding ridge.
Almost at the same time, the Pawnee was
at the end of the hill; he looked for a moment
down the steep—he half urged forward
his foaming horse, then reining him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
in, turned away, and commenced his return
towards the party. As he was leaving
the summit of the eminence, he looked
around for the animal which had escaped
him, but he had disappeared in a clump
of shrubbery. Seeing the pursuit was
ended, the Pawnees folded their robes
around them, the Otoes shouldered their
guns, and the whole party resumed its
journey.</p>

<p>In company with <i>Hah-che-kah-sug-hah</i>
I soon after left the party and commenced
a hunt over the prairie. We were overtaken
by a young Otoe called “the Buffalo
Chief.” He was armed with a rifle;
and was a keen and generally a successful
hunter. Several Pawnees also came loitering
up, for they always hang in the
wake of the hunters, in hopes of obtaining
a portion of what is killed.</p>

<p>We directed our course towards a lofty
skirt of forest, fringed with brushwood.
Here we thought that we might hunt successfully;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
but the night closed in, and still
we were empty handed. So we were obliged
to set out in search of the spot, which we
supposed would be the site of our night
encampment. The Indians moved forward
with a swift, unwearied step. They seemed
to glide along. Their blankets fluttered
in the slight current produced by
the rapidity of their motions, and I was
obliged to hurry swiftly on, lest I should
lose sight of them. An hour passed; they
still pushed forward; they spoke not a
word; not a sign of intelligence passed
between them; they moved on rapidly
through the dark, as if they guided their
course by instinct.</p>

<p>“Ugh!” ejaculated Hah-che-kah-sug-hah,
stopping short, and looking earnestly
at some object upon the black sod.</p>

<p>“Ugh! ugh! ugh!” burst from the
chests of several of the Pawnees, as they
gathered round the suspicious object, and
bent down, to examine it more closely. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
came up to them, but could see nothing.
The Indian pointed to the ground, and
after much difficulty, I descried the faint
impression of a moccassin upon the ashes
of the burnt grass, though it would have
escaped any, save the keen and ever-observing
eye of an Indian.</p>

<p>A few words passed between two of the
Otoes; then turning off they followed
steadily upon the unknown track. They
appeared to trace it without difficulty,
though to me it was totally invisible.</p>

<p>In about ten minutes, there was another
burst from the Indians, and a broad gray
line, traced across the black prairie, and
visible even in the darkness, announced
that we had at length come upon the trail
of our party. Here the Indians turned off
in the direction indicated by the line, and
passing down a deep hollow, we ascended
a hill. From its summit we perceived at
a short distance, a dusky uncertain outline
of timber, in a hollow; and the blazes of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
fires glimmering, and flickering among the
trees, assured us that we had at last reached
the resting place of the party. The
camp lay nestled in a large grove of
trees. Within a few yards of it, the
Nemahaw river brawled over a stony
bottom, with wild, and not unpleasing
murmurings.</p>

<p>The Indians had distributed themselves
about the open woodland, in groups of five
or six. Each group had its own night-fire,
and a rough shed of boughs, to protect
it from the dew. In the centre of the
grove, and strongly reflecting the light of
the fire, stood the canvas tents of the
whites, and reposing before a pile of blazing
logs, were the uncouth forms of the
soldiers; their appearance at present being
little less wild, than that of the Indians.
At one end of the heavy logs, was
stretched the demi-savage, half-breed interpreter,
reposing after the labours of the
day, and gazing sleepily upon the fire,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
which blazed high amid the gathered timber.
One or two Otoes were mingled with
the whites; but the rest of the trusty band
with the old Iotan, as master of ceremonies,
were collected round a large fire,
which burnt brightly at a few yards’ distance.
The graceful form of the Iotan’s
wife, was reclining upon a pile of dried
grass, beneath a canopy of green boughs,
which had been formed for her, by the
young men of the Otoe party. Notwithstanding
the assurances of the doctor,
that she was recovering, she persisted
in her resolution of remaining an invalid;
for as long as she travelled in this
character, the soft heart of the soldier
who drove the wagon, prevented his refusing
her a seat in the vehicle; and the
fiery-tempered old Iotan still insisted, that
the young Indians should perform her
share of the drudgery.</p>

<p>There was something wildly noble,
about this little band of Otoes. They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
were adorned with all the coxcombry of
Indians, before they have degenerated
from savage men, to civilized beasts.
There was a frank, gallant bearing about
them; a native chivalry, which caused us
almost unconsciously to place more confidence
in them, than in their fierce, untamed
associates. Behind them, resting
against the trees, were their borrowed
rifles, glittering beneath the blaze of the
fire. Around us in every direction, were
the rough wicker sheds of the Pawnees,
their fires gleaming with an uncertain,
lurid light, among the tall, straight trunks
of the overhanging grove.</p>

<p>The Indians in their shaggy robes, were
flitting to and fro like troubled spirits;
now hid in the gloom of the night, and
now their dark eyes glittering, and their
painted faces glaring, as they moved in
the light of some blazing pile. Some had
wrapped their robes closely round them,
and sat buried in a gloomy reverie, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
their scowling eyes fixed upon the burning
logs, taking no part in the conversation
of their comrades, nor any note of what
was going on around them.</p>

<p>At length one of the young warriors
struck up a wild song, which made the
woods re-echo. Another joined it, and another,
until the whole of the group round
that fire, were engrossed in the theme. A
single voice from a distant pile then struck
in, another followed. Another fire then
added its voice, and gradually it spread
from one group to another, until every
throat in the whole Pawnee troop, had
united in it. It sung of war, and well
did the gestures, and wildly energetic
tones of the singers, express the meaning
of the words. In parts, the blended
voices swelled on the night air, with a
mournfully melodious sound; but when
the howl, with which they ended every
verse, burst from the throats of the whole
band, it was thrilling and fearful. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
Otoes caught the wild enthusiasm of the
moment, and they too added their voices
to the savage concert, until it almost seemed
to rend the black canopy above us.</p>

<p>The song was kept up till after midnight;
for long after we had retired to
our tents, it frequently awoke us from our
slumbers, or mingled in the phantasmagoria
of our dreams.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

</div>

<p class="small center mb2"><i>Separation from Party.—Burning Prairie.—Wolves.—Journey.</i></p>

<p>It was scarcely sunrise, before the dark
grove echoed with preparations for our
departure. The voice of our mongrel
French boy, Joe, was heard, hailing the
mules, which had strayed for pasturage,
some distance down the bottom. The soldiers
loaded the pack-horses; the Pawnees
collected together their scanty stock
of cooking utensils, and packed them upon
the back of a lean, bony nag, whose evil
destiny had made him drudge-horse to the
Indian host; and the old Iotan saw his wife
snugly tucked away in one of the dearborn
wagons, and stationed himself as
guide, at the border of the forest, waiting
for the movements of the band.</p>

<p>It was a cold, blustering day, with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
clear and cloudless sky. The wind swept
in sudden gusts through the creaking
trees, and the dead prairie grass waved
and rustled as the gale brushed over it.</p>

<p>In a short time the party wound out of
the grove, and struck across the prairie,
in the direction taken by the Iotan. He
had been a bold marauder in his youth,
and had traversed every woody nook, and
every prairie swell which lay in this quarter.
When standing upon some high bluff,
he would call his young warriors round
him, and point out the different scenes of
his exploits. “There,” said he, pointing
to some clustering forest, “there have I
scalped the Osages, and there,” pointing
in another direction, “have I stolen
horses from the same nation. There is
not a grove which has not echoed the
screams of my enemies, or borne witness
to my plunderings. There is not a bottom
in which I have not encamped, nor a swell
which I have not crossed, either in hunting,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
or when bound upon some war expedition.”
He loved in his old age to dwell
upon the deeds of his youth, and when narrating
them, his faded features would light
up, and his eye would flash, “for then,”
said he, “my arm was heavy and my
limbs were strong.” Yet it seemed to me
they could not have been much heavier, or
stronger, unless they had been iron itself.
Such was the Indian who acted as guide,
and led the way in front of our party;
nor could I see that age had impaired
his vigour; for in traversing hills and ravines,
forests and streams, I never knew
his step to flag or falter, or his frame to
show any symptoms of fatigue.</p>

<p>After following him for a short time, I
turned off, in company with a strapping
soldier named McClanahan, to search for
wild turkeys, which are abundant in the
forests skirting the Nemahaw. We traversed
several glades, opening in a thick
growth of timber; but although we saw<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
many, we were for a long time unable to
get a shot at them.</p>

<p>In beating up the forest we separated,
and I soon lost sight of my companion;
though for nearly an hour I occasionally
heard the report of his rifle, sometimes
near, and sometimes far off. Gradually
each discharge appeared to be more distant,
and at length they ceased altogether.
I kept on after the turkeys without killing
any. Sometimes I succeeded in <i>winging</i>
one, and then followed a hot scrambling
chase through bushes, briars, and underwood,
which invariably terminated in the
escape of the bird.</p>

<p>Several hours had passed in this way.
I had strayed many miles through the bottom,
when the height of the sun warned
me that it was near mid-day, and time to
think of rejoining my companions.</p>

<p>Leaving the woods I took to the prairie,
and sought the trail of the party, and for
several hours pursued my course, examining<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
every hill and hollow, in hopes of finding
it; but no trail could I see. As the
day waned, I increased my speed; but
still without success. The prairie was
deserted. The long grass waved before
the blast but not a living thing met my
eye. I then feared that I might have
crossed the trace without noticing it; but
the more I thought of it, the more impossible
did it seem, that the heavy track of so
numerous a body of men, should have escaped
my eye. I ascended a ridge which
commanded a wide prospect. A wilderness
of grass was before me, with small
rolling hills extending in every direction;
but there was no appearance of my companions;
nothing to be seen, but the sky
and the prairie. It was time to seek a
resting place for the night. I looked
round for some tree, but not one was in
sight. Dead grass, wild weeds, and withered
stalks, were the only covering of the
hills. I was like a mariner alone in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
midst of an ocean. I knew not which
way to turn. If I travelled to the west I
might be approaching my companions, or
I might be going from them; and then
too, I would be journeying away from the
settlements. So I at length determined
to take an easterly course, until I reached
the Missouri, which I intended should be
my guide to the abodes of the whites.</p>

<p>With a quick pace I pressed forward,
anxious to find a sheltering place for the
night. It was the end of October; the
wind was chilling, and I was clad in a
dress of drilling, such as is used only for
summer wear. Just as the sun was sinking,
I caught sight of a line of forest, at
many miles’ distance. This acted like a
spur upon a jaded horse. With fresh
spirits I bounded down the sides of the
prairie swells, and forced my way through
the tall, clogging grass. But at last the
sun set, and as the twilight darkened, objects
grew indistinct, and the forest which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
could not have been more than two miles
off, was gradually lost in the obscurity.
In front of me was a large hill; I ascended
it, to wait on its summit until the moon
rose; for I feared to lose my course in the
darkness.</p>

<p>A feeling of very desolation came over
me, as I sat there, with nothing but the
dreary waste around me, and the blue,
cold sky twinkling with stars, above. The
wind had increased to a gale, and swept
howling along, occasionally bearing with
it the yell of some prowling wolf. For
hours I sat shivering, with my eyes fixed
upon the eastern horizon, watching eagerly
for the moon; and never had I greeted
her appearance, with such heartfelt pleasure,
as when she emerged to view.</p>

<p>I resumed my journey, and after toiling
for an hour, through a wide bottom of tall
weeds and matted grass, I reached the
grove—erected a small shed of boughs
after the manner of the Indians, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
lying down was soon asleep, before a huge
fire, which I built against the trunk of a
fallen tree.</p>

<p>I was awakened by the increasing violence
of the gale. At times it sank into
low wailings, and then would swell again,
howling and whistling through the trees.
After sitting by the fire for a short time,
I again threw myself upon my pallet of
dried grass, but could not sleep. There
was something dismal and thrilling in the
sound of the wind. At times, wild voices
seemed shrieking through the woodland.
It was in vain that I closed my eyes; a
kind of superstitious feeling came over
me, and though I saw nothing, my ears
drank in every sound. I gazed around in
every direction, and sat with my hand on
my gun-trigger, for my feelings were so
wrought up, that I momentarily expected
to see an armed Indian start from behind
each bush. At last I rose up, and sat
by the fire. Suddenly, a swift gust swept<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
through the grove, and whirled off sparks
and cinders in every direction. In an
instant, fifty little fires, shot their forked
tongues in the air, and seemed to
flicker with a momentary struggle for existence.
There was scarcely time to note
their birth, before they were creeping up
in a tall, tapering blaze and leaping lightly
along the tops of the scattering clumps of
dry grass. In another moment they leaped
forward into the prairie, and a waving
line of brilliant flame, quivered high up
in the dark atmosphere.</p>

<p>Another gust came rushing along the
ravine. It was announced by a distant
moan; as it came nearer a cloud of dry
leaves filled the air; the slender shrubs and
saplings bent like weeds—dry branches
snapped and crackled. The lofty forest
trees writhed, and creaked, and groaned.
The next instant the furious blast reached
the flaming prairie. Myriads and myriads
of bright embers were flung wildly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
up in the air: flakes of blazing grass,
whirled like meteors through the sky.
The flame spread into a vast sheet, that
swept over the prairie, bending forward,
illumining the black waste which it had
passed, and shedding a red light far down
the deep vistas of the forest; though all
beyond the blaze was of a pitchy blackness.
The roaring flames, drowned even
the howling of the wind. At each succeeding
blast, they threw long pyramidal
streams upwards in the black sky, then
flared horizontally, and seemed to bound
forward, lighting at each bound, a new
conflagration. Leap succeeded leap; the
flames rushed onward with a race-horse
speed. The noise sounded like the roar
of a stormy ocean, and the wild, tumultuous
billows of flame, were tossed about like
a sea of fire. Directly in their course,
and some distance out in the prairie, stood
a large grove of oaks—the dry leaves still
clinging to the branches. There was a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
red glare thrown upon them, from the
blazing flood. A moment passed, and a
black smoke oozed from the nearest tree—the
blaze roared among their branches,
and shot up for a hundred feet in the air—waving
as if in triumph. The effect was
transient. In a moment had the fire swept
through a grove covering several acres.
It sank again into the prairie, leaving the
limbs of every tree scathed and scorched
to an inky blackness; and shining with
a bright crimson light, between their
branches. In this way the light conflagration
swept over the landscape: every
hill seemed to burn its own funeral pyre,
and the scorching heat licked up every
blade in the hollows. A dark cloud of
gray smoke, filled with burning embers,
spread over the course of the flames, occasionally
forming not ungraceful columns,
which were almost instantly shattered by
the wind, and driven in a thousand different
directions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span></p>

<p>For several hours the blaze continued
to rage, and the whole horizon became
girdled with a belt of living fire. As
the circle extended, the flames appeared
smaller and smaller: until they looked like
a slight golden thread drawn around the
hills. They then must have been nearly
ten miles distant. At length the blaze
disappeared, although the purple light,
that for hours illumined the night sky,
told that the element was extending into
other regions of the prairies.</p>

<p>It was sunrise when I rose from my resting
place and resumed my journey. What
a change! All was waste. The sun had
set upon a prairie still clothed in its natural
garb of herbage. It rose upon a scene
of desolation. Not a single weed—not a
blade of grass, was left. The tall grove,
which at sunset was covered with withered
foliage, now spread a labyrinth of
scorched and naked branches—the very
type of ruin. A thin covering of gray<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
ashes was sprinkled upon the ground beneath,
and several large, dead trees, whose
dried branches had caught and nourished
the flame, were still blazing or sending up
long spires of smoke. In every direction,
barrenness marked the track of the flames.
It had even worked its course against the
blast, hugging to the roots of the tall grass.</p>

<p>The wind was still raging; cinders and
ashes were drifting, and whirling about,
in almost suffocating clouds, sometimes
rendering it impossible to see for more
than one or two hundred yards.</p>

<p>In surveying the dreary landscape, I
caught sight of a gaunt, gray prairie wolf,
stealing with a thief-like step down one of
the hollows, as if his spirit was cowed by
the scene. He was the only living thing
to be seen. He saw his fellow-wanderer,
but he did not fly. The very desolation
around, appeared to have brought him a
link nearer to man, for he had lost his
terrors of him. He paused as he reached<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
the foot of the hill. Here he uttered a
low, querulous howl, which was answered
from the woods, and three others emerged
from the timber, and joined him.</p>

<p>They stood for a few moments gazing
at me, and then commenced slowly to
approach. I knew that there was not a
more cowardly beast upon the prairie, than
the wolf; but a chill shot over me, as I saw
them advance. It seemed as if they regarded
me, as the cause of the desolation,
that had swept over their homes; and I
felt guilty and lonely.</p>

<p>But even amid this want of companionship,
I had no relish for that of wolves:
so I raised my rifle, and sent a bullet among
them. A loud howl answered its report;
and the limping step of one of them, as
the gang fled for the woods, convinced
me, that my messenger had performed its
errand.</p>

<p>I now gave up the hopeless task of
searching for my fellow travellers; and as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
the Iotan had mentioned, that they were
but a few days’ journey from the settlements,
I shouldered my rifle, and taking
an easterly course, by aid of the sun, started
forward, trusting to make my way to the
abodes of white men. It was weary wandering.
Hill succeeded hill, and one valley
swept off into another. The faint
tracery of distant trees, disappeared as I
journeyed onward, and soon there was
nothing to be seen but the cold, unspecked
blue of the sky, and the boundless black
of the ravaged prairie.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

</div>

<p class="small center mb2"><i>A Hunted Deer.—Deserted Encampment.—Distant
Indians.—Night Camp.—Owls.—Burning
Sycamore.</i></p>

<p>For hours I continued my course, pausing
upon the summit of every hill, in a
faint, but vain hope of seeing my comrades.
At last, at a distance, I saw a deer
scouring over the top of a ridge, and
making directly towards me. I crouched
upon the burnt sod, cocked my rifle, and
waited for him. I wondered at his speed,
for there was no hunter in sight; but it
was soon explained. As he descended
into a hollow, three wolves came following
at full speed, over the hill. The deer
soon rose out of the bend, and kept on
towards me. Almost without breathing, I
watched him. I had eaten nothing since
the morning of the preceding day, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
there was something of ferocity in my feelings,
as I gazed at him. I gathered my
feet under me, and slowly raised my rifle.
The animal still approached. I should
have waited; but a burning feverishness
rendered me impatient, and while he was
at least a hundred and fifty yards distant,
I rose and took aim. He stopped short,
and gazed steadily at me, with his head
raised high in the air, and presenting only
his front. I pulled the trigger; the bullet
might have grazed him, but did him
no injury. He did not wait for a second
shot, but darted like an arrow across the
prairie. I watched him until he faded
from my sight, and then re-loaded my
rifle.</p>

<p>This incident, which for an instant had
diverted the current of my thoughts, now
served only to render them more heavy.
At the sound of my rifle, the wolves in
pursuit, had scampered off as hastily in
one direction, as the deer had done in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
other; and I felt a kind of selfish satisfaction
in knowing, that if I had not been
able to obtain a meal from his ribs, this
gang of vagabonds was equally disappointed.</p>

<p>Once more I proceeded on my journey,
directing my course by the sun. I had
hunted much on foot, and my limbs had
become hardened by toil; so that I could
journey long without sinking, though not
without feeling fatigue. It was about an
hour after mid-day when I again came in
sight of a forest. There was a golden
mark upon the prairie. The blackness
stopped abruptly, and pointed out the spot
where the fire, from some cause or other,
had ceased its course in this direction. A
lowering column of smoke, however, hanging
like a sullen pall, in another quarter,
showed that the element was still at work.</p>

<p>Within half an hour, I reached the
wood, and striking an Indian trail, entered
it. It was a grove of tall, and beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
hickories; and in the centre were
the remains of an Indian hunting-camp.
It had been occupied for some time, as the
frames of the wigwams were more strong
and durable in their structure, than those
usually erected for transient purposes.
They could have been abandoned but
lately; for the bark was still green on the
boughs composing them, and there were
the recent foot-prints of horses. The dead
pea-vines were trampled down by hoofs:
and there was one rock, jutting out in the
small stream meandering through the
grove, which was covered with racoon
fur, and here and there sprinkled with
drops of blood. I sat down upon the rock,
watched the waters, and thought of the
former occupants of the grove. Had I
been a day sooner, I might have met them;
but then they might have been enemies.
So I began to think that things were better
as they were; for even the most friendly
tribes, are apt to lose their good will towards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
he whites, when a single one falls
into their power. Desolate as I was, I
could not but be sensible of the beauty of
the grove. I could see far down deep
vistas, gilded here and there by the sunbeams.
The wind had gradually died away.
The stream glided murmuring over a rocky
bottom, and here and there glittered like
silver in the beams of the sun. The wild
cry of the blue-jay was heard, hailing
some noisy comrade in a distant tree-top.
As I sat looking upon the water, I heard a
slight noise in the stream, above me, and
caught sight of a number of wood-ducks,
borne on by the current. They are a beautiful
bird. Now they glided beneath the
shade of some plant that drooped over the
water’s edge; now they whirled easily
round, as some changeful current caught
them in its lilliputian whirlpool. They
chased each other sportively across the
water, sometimes scouring up the stream,
then again relinquishing themselves to its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
course. They were small game, but I was
famished, and had my rifle in readiness.
I waited until I got two of them in a range,
and then fired. My bullet struck off the
head of the first, and considerably confused
the ideas of the second; but after splashing
about, bottom upwards, and trying
several other novel modes of navigation,
he recovered himself, and flew after his
companions.</p>

<p>Having secured my prize, I crossed the
brook, and struck into a winding pathway,
which led up the steep bank opposite.</p>

<p>I had scarcely left the grove, when upon
looking round, I caught sight of a train of
figures moving along the top of a ridge,
far away to the westward. There were
six in it, and they must have been many
miles distant. So faint was their outline, and
so small did they appear in the vast space
that lay open in that direction, that they
reminded me of the dim, spectre-like forms
of a phantasmagoria. At first I felt a start<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
of joy, for I thought that they might be
my companions: but a second reflection
convinced me that I was mistaken, for the
train was moving along to the northwest—the
very reverse of the route to the settlements.
Then too the idea flashed across
me, that they must be Indians—perhaps
hostile ones. Although so distant that there
was scarcely a probability of their seeing
me, I returned to the grove, where I
watched their gliding forms, until they at
last sunk behind one of the ridges, and
then I pursued my course. In front of
me again, was a prairie which had escaped
the flame, and was covered with herbage.
But though it was pleasing to the eye, I
soon began to wish for the black waste;
for the tangled grass impeded my steps,
and rendered my journey extremely toilsome.
I had not accomplished many miles
before the sun began to sink in the west.
I then determined to travel no farther that
night, but take up my quarters in a small<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
clump of trees, which clustered like an
island upon the borders of a brook. I
collected a pile of dry wood; kindled a
fire; made a spit of a green twig, on which
I impaled my duck, and stuck it upright
in the ground in front of the fire; then
stretching myself upon a bed of dry grass,
I watched the roasting of my supper with
a hungry eye. When I had made a meal
with the relish of a half-famished man, I
turned upon my bed and fell asleep. After
a time I awoke; added fresh fuel to the
fire, and stretched myself upon my pallet,
again to sleep.</p>

<p>It was a bright and beautiful night; the
moon was shining amidst myriads of stars,
veiled now and then by a light, fleecy
cloud, from which she seemed to emerge
with increased splendour. I lay gazing
at her as she moved along like a queen
surrounded by her maids of honour.</p>

<p>“Whoop! whoop! whoo!” sounded a
loud voice near me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span></p>

<p>I started to my feet: for I thought that
I had heard a human cry; perhaps one of
my party, and with a loud hail I answered
the sound.</p>

<p>“Whoop! whoo! whoo!” again repeated
the voice. A gigantic sycamore reared
its naked and scathed trunk in the moonlight.
At the extremity of a single dry
limb, which stretched out from nearly the
top of the tree, was seated an owl of the
largest species.</p>

<p>He repeated the cry which had started
me. “Whoop! whoo! whoo!”</p>

<p>“Whoop! whoo! whoo!” responded
another from a different quarter, and a
dusky bird flitted by, and perched on the
long limb beside his companion. I again
stretched myself upon my couch and
watched them, as they sat between me
and the moon. There was a confused
jabbering carried on between them: they
probably had charge of the grove, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
were puzzled, at the intrusion of a stranger.
After debating for some time, they
concluded to take a nearer view of the intruder,
and descended to a lower branch.
Here they carried on the debate; apparently
wondering who I was, and what I
wanted. They rubbed their huge heads
together with an air of vast perplexity:
they rocked and fluttered on their perch.
Occasionally one of them threw his head
on one side, and cast a very inquisitive
look down upon me; and then a fresh jabbering
went on. After about fifteen minutes
spent in this way, the two dignitaries
giving a farewell “whoop! whoop!
whoo!” flapped off and disappeared.</p>

<p>Again I turned and fixed my gaze upon
the moon. There was a feeling of fellowship
connected with it. I knew that other
eyes were resting upon her pale orb, and
I knew that while she was shining upon
my solitary couch, she was at the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
time pouring her mellow light, upon the
abodes of my friends, far away and unconscious
of my situation.</p>

<p>Chilled by the night air, I turned away
and looked into the fire—forming palaces,
groves, and arcades, amid its glowing embers,
until gradually my eyes closed, and
I slept.</p>

<p>When I awoke the sun was shining, and
I resumed my solitary journey. I continued
on foot from sunrise till sunset, without
seeing a living thing, unless, perhaps,
a distant deer; and halted for the night,
in a forest of thick timber. I found a
large, dead sycamore standing upright,
with a complete chamber formed in its
trunk by decay. I kindled a fire in front
of it, and filled the empty trunk with dried
grass, and pea-vines for a couch. I was
wearied and slept soundly, until near midnight,
when I was awakened by the intense
heat. The fire had by some means
communicated to a pile of fuel, which I had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
collected to sustain it during the night.
This was in a furious blaze, causing the old
tree to smoke with the heat. The hollow
trunk was no place for me, unless I chose to
be roasted. I pulled my cap from my head,
and wrapped it round my powder-horn—seized
my rifle, and sprang through the
fire. The next instant, the flame leaped
upon my bed of dried vines, and the whole
interior of the dead tree, was in a blaze,
that lasted for an instant and then expired.
As it was no longer possible to return to
it, I seated myself upon a stump, and remained
half shivering, half dozing, until
morning.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

</div>

<p class="small center mb2"><i>Wild Turkey.—Squirrel.—Parroquets.—Trail.—Konza
Indian.—Night Camp.—Deserted
House.—Konza Agency.—Reaching Leavenworth.</i></p>

<p>Before the sun had risen, I was on my
way, directing my course by the purple
streak in the east, which announced his
approach. This was the morning of the
fourth day since I had parted from my
companions. I had made but one meal,
and the cravings of hunger were becoming
excessive. I looked round, when I reached
the edge of the prairie, but saw nothing;
I looked through the bottom of
forest, but no game was visible. I stretched
out my leg, looked at the leather
legging which covered it, and considered
whether it was easy of digestion. I felt
it; it <i>was</i> rather tough; so I determined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
to keep on, and wait till night, before I
proceeded to extremities.</p>

<p>Just then, I caught sight of a turkey,
leading a troop to take an airing in the
prairie. I whizzed a bullet after him;
his wing dropped and dragged, and I commenced
a hot pursuit. But though I had
injured his wing, I had not damaged his
legs, and after following him for nearly
fifteen minutes, I threw myself down completely
exhausted. The rest of the <i>gang</i>,
taking advantage of the diversion created
in their favour, had disappeared among
the trees. I gave up all hopes of again
finding them, and wandered slowly along
the edge of the woods. As I was winding
my way through the trees, I heard a
loud <i>click</i> above me, and observed a large
red squirrel springing from one limb to
another, of a bur-oak. As he caught
sight of me, he darted round the trunk
and peered out, with about an inch of
his head, to take an observation. I was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
hungry, and this cowardly manœuvre made
me angry. I determined, that <i>have</i> that
squirrel I <i>would</i>, if I spent the whole day
in shooting at him. I rested my rifle
against the trunk of a tree, and after a long
aim, fired; the bullet dashed the head of
the little animal to pieces, and whirled
him some twenty feet off in the air.</p>

<p>I had lost my knife on the day previous,
but with the assistance of a nail which I
found in my pouch, I skinned my prize,
and impaling him upon the point of a spit
made of a dry stick, stuck it in the ground
before the fire to roast. While the process
of cooking was going forward, a flock
of screaming parroquets came whirling
through the trees; but upon catching
sight of me, they determined to stop and
see what I was about. They accordingly
alighted upon a dead tree directly above
me, casting side-looks down upon my roast,
and from the joyous chattering that they
kept up, no doubt were congratulating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
each other, upon having called, just in
time to be invited to breakfast. But I had
a meal in store for them, of a very different
description; for after hovering round
under the tree, for some time, I contrived
to get three of them in a range, and fired.
My bullet missed, and the flock whirled
off, though I could hear their voices raised
in a clamorous outcry, at my want of civility,
long after they had disappeared
among the trees.</p>

<p>I despatched my breakfast with a ravenous
appetite, and taking with me the skin
of the animal, to serve as a future meal in
case of extremity, I continued my course
until it was afternoon. However, I was
now becoming perplexed. I thought to
have reached the settlements before this.
Still I saw no signs of human habitation,
and I began to yield to the idea, which,
strange as it may seem, invariably fastens
itself upon persons, when wandering, bewildered
through these regions. I thought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
<i>that the sun had got turned and was setting
in the east</i>. For some time this idea
was strong; but I remembered the almost
parting words of an old hunter, who accompanied
our party. “Look ye,” said
he, “you straggle so much from the party,
that some day or other you will not be
able to find it again. Then, all you have
to do, is to keep straight away for the east.
It will be sure to bring you right in the
end. But remember one thing—never
get bothered. When the sun rises, strike
to the east, and don’t <i>do</i>, as many have
done when puzzled; don’t think that the
sun rises or sets wrong: for if you do,
you will go to the d——l.” I was becoming
bewildered, and I remembered this
advice, just at the time when it was most
needful. So I turned my back towards
what I had been positive was the east, and
travelled in the direction, which I was
equally positive was the west.</p>

<p>I had continued along the prairie for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
some hours, when suddenly I struck into
a wide trail. There were four paths running
along side by side, all evidently
much travelled, and bearing prints of
recent hoofs. While I was examining
them narrowly, I caught the trace of a
wagon wheel. New strength seemed to
course through my limbs at this discovery,
and I bounded along the path, as swiftly as
if I had just started, upon a fresh and joyous
journey. I continued in the trail for
several hours. On my right, was a tall,
dense bottom of timber; and here and there,
through the branches, I could perceive
the waters of a mighty river. I instantly
supposed this to be the Missouri; that I
had struck the trail which led to Leavenworth,
and that by continuing in this
direction, I would be able to reach it before
nightfall. I walked swiftly forward
for some time; but still I could see nothing
that I recognized. If it was the
road to Leavenworth I had passed it before,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
and ought to recall the landmarks:
but here all was new. As I was looking
around I caught sight of a black speck
moving over the distant path, which I had
already passed. It came nearer and nearer.
I could discern that it was a horseman.
It might be one of the officers from the
garrison, and I slackened my pace for him
to come up; but as he came nearer I discovered
that he was an Indian. I was
then certain that I must be on the banks
of the Konzas; that I had struck too far to
the south, and had reached it before its
junction with the Missouri. I had been
longing feverishly for the sight of a human
being; yet no sooner did I behold one,
than my first movement was to await his
approach, with my finger upon my trigger.
When he drew near, he held up the palm
of his hand, in token of friendship, and
galloped directly up to me. He was a
fine-looking man of the Konza tribe, apparently
not above thirty—wrapped in a blue<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
blanket, armed with a rifle, and mounted
upon a black pony. He alighted; struck
fire, and lit his pipe, for a smoke. From
that moment we were friends. I learned
from him, that the river near, was the
Konzas, and that it would be daylight before
I could reach the nearest abode of a
white man. As soon as our truce was settled,
my Indian friend mounted, and left
me to follow on foot as well as I was able.
I was wearied and hungry, and this want
of civility did not increase the mildness
of my disposition. I trudged after him;
while he occasionally thumped his little
nag into a trot, casting a look behind, to
see whether I could contrive to keep up
with him. This vexed me, and I began
to cast around, for the means of paying the
fellow for his ill breeding. He at last
checked his horse—reached out his rifle
with the lock broken, and wished me to
mend it. He then handed me a horn,
without a grain of powder in it, and wished<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
me to fill it. I took the gun, and blew
into the muzzle; the air passed freely
through the touch-hole. “Ha!” thought
I, “it is not charged; so Mr. Indian I
have you on the hip.” I quietly reached
it to him, and he, seeing that I was not
disposed to put it in order, took it and
said nothing more about the matter.</p>

<p>We proceeded in silence until we reached
the edge of a narrow stream, about two
feet in depth, which ran across the route.
Here the Indian paused, by which means
I came up with him, and signified my wish
to mount his horse to cross the water. He
demurred at first, but I persisted; I had
a loaded rifle; his was empty: so I gave
myself airs, and “spoke as one having
authority.” At last, though with evident
reluctance, he acceded to my request, and
in another moment I was behind him on
the horse, and upon the opposite side of
the brook. I had been mounted only for
a few moments; but I found the transition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
far from disagreeable. I was wearied with
walking, and there was something highly
pleasing in travelling upon other legs than
my own. I therefore quietly retained my
seat; and though my companion halted the
horse, for the purpose of my dismounting,
I was so satisfied with my situation, that I
pretended not to understand his meaning,
and listened to his words, and viewed his
gestures with an appearance of the greatest
stolidity. At length, he determined
to endeavour to shake me off. For this
purpose he wriggled and twisted in his
seat. I, however, clung still more closely
to him; and the only one that appeared
annoyed by the action, was the horse, who
expressed his displeasure by kicking up.</p>

<p>The Indian finding this unsuccessful,
increased the speed of his nag to a gallop—but
in vain; I was as securely fixed
behind, as the Old Man of the Sea, to the
shoulders of Sinbad. At length he gave
up, and checking his horse sprang off.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
As he did this I slid forward into his seat. I
felt some twinges respecting my ungrateful
conduct, but my weariness overcame them.</p>

<p>My next object was to gain something
to eat; for notwithstanding the squirrel, I
felt a vacuum within, that required filling.
I observed that my fellow traveller carried
a bundle of dried venison, slung from
his shoulder. I accordingly signified to
him that I had eaten nothing for two
days—at the same time pointing to the
venison: but the fellow was obstinate; he
shook his head, and afterwards whenever
I started the subject, he looked in a different
direction. Finding that fair means
were of no avail, I determined to try
what foul could do. As I was mounted,
I resolved that he should think I intended
to scamper off with his horse: so I thumped
my rifle against his ribs, and scoured
along the trail at full gallop.</p>

<p>The moment I started, the Indian followed,
with a speed that almost equalled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
that of the pony; but unfortunately for
himself, his wind was soon exhausted. He
then began to think of a compromise, and
at last with much reluctance, loosed a piece
of the deer’s flesh, and held it up towards
me, at the same time signifying by his
gestures, that if I would stop, he would
give me a portion. This was all that I
desired; and pulling in the horse, I received
the venison, and dismounted—relinquishing
the nag to his owner. He, however,
thinking the treaty between us, not
yet sufficiently ratified, immediately lit his
pipe, and passed it to me for a second
smoke. We then set out, and at dusk
reached a small wood: here the Indian
hobbled his horse, and throwing a few
sticks together, he kindled a fire. He
then offered me a small piece of venison,
which he had broiled upon the coals; after
which he drew his blanket round him, and
stretched himself at full length on one side
of the fire, while I threw myself across<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
my rifle, on the other. I must have slept
for an hour. When I awoke it was intensely
cold, the fire having burnt very
low. My companion lay exactly as I left
him when going to sleep; he did not seem
to notice that the fire was expiring, nor did
the cold seem to affect him.</p>

<p>I rose up and stood over him; but he
did not move. I then stirred him with my
foot, and shouted to him—at the same
time motioning to him, to assist in collecting
wood to keep alive the fire. He apparently
was aware of my object, for all I
could elicit, was a grunt; nor would he
even open his eyes to look at me. So in
no very pleasant humour, I went in search
of fuel, taking my rifle with me.</p>

<p>I had not gone far, before I came upon
his little devil of a horse. I was so much
vexed with the master, that I could not
help bestowing a thwack upon the animal,
who came smelling up to me, with the air
of an old acquaintance. With a loud snort,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
and a half attempt at a kick, he hobbled
off, as well as the confined state of his legs
would let him.</p>

<p>Hard of hearing, and difficult to rouse,
as the Indian had been, when I attempted
it, no sooner was the tramping sound of
the horse’s hoofs heard, as he crashed over
the dead brushwood, than he sprang to his
feet and came flying towards me with the
swiftness of a deer.</p>

<p>I have but little doubt, that he thought
I had served him an Indian trick, and was
scouring off through the bushes with his
nag. As it was, when he found him safe,
he was for returning to stretch himself before
the fire. I however arrested him, and
motioned to him to assist in carrying a
large limb to our sleeping place; which
he did with evident reluctance; for he
seemed to possess in a high degree the
Indian aversion to labour.</p>

<p>About midnight he awakened me, and
signified that it was time to be on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
move. He first unhobbled his horse, and
led him to the bank of the river, which
was clayey and very steep, for the purpose
of watering him. Here a violent
contest took place between the nag and
the Indian: the first being afraid to venture
down the slippery descent, and the
master endeavouring by coaxing and kicking
to induce him to advance. He had
planted his feet in the very edge of the
bank, and although his nose and head were
pulled out to a horizontal line, by the
efforts of the Indian, the rest of his body
was as immoveable, as one of the trees
around. The Indian then made signs to
me to assist him, for he seemed determined
that the horse should drink, whether
thirsty or not. I did not feel in a very
good humour with him, but as he seemed
to wish it, I bestowed a few hearty thwacks
upon the hinder parts of the animal, which
seemed only to increase his desire to retrograde,
instead of advancing. Finding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
this of no avail, I seized a small sapling,
and placing it under his belly, made use
of it as a lever, to press him sidewise over
the bank. The pressure against his ribs,
drove him within a foot of the edge. I
placed the pole beyond the verge of the
bank, and again made use of it as a lever;
it pushed him still nearer. He made a
violent effort to resist; but just then the
Indian jerked his little halter violently,
and over the horse went, treading upon
the toes of his master, and sousing heels
over head in the river, where he swam up
and down, puffing and snorting. Several
times he attempted to climb the bank; but
rolled back, and floundered in the water.
The Indian was now alarmed lest he should
be drowned. But he at last succeeded in
helping him up the steep, and being satisfied
that his thirst was completely quenched,
he once more hobbled him, and then
signified that we should move forward.
Before starting, however, he took from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
his shoulders his load of venison, and
hung it upon a tree. I then followed him
silently, though I could not imagine why
he had left his venison, or why he travelled
on foot, when he had a horse to carry
him. We soon came to a river, across
which, though full of ice, we waded, and
then started forward on a trail which led
through a wood. Occasionally I took the
lead; but the trail grew so indistinct, that
I was obliged to give place to my companion,
who always kept on without hesitation.</p>

<p>We had travelled about twelve miles,
making many circuits and windings, and
striking from one trail to another, until we
emerged from the wood, and I found myself
again near the bank of the Konzas
river. Before me was a large house, with
a court-yard in front. I sprang with joy
through the unhung gate, and ran to the
door. It was open; I shouted; my voice
echoed through the rooms: but there was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
no answer. I walked in. The doors of
the inner chambers were swinging from
their hinges, and long grass was growing
through the crevices of the floor. While
I stood gazing around, an owl flitted by,
and dashed out of an unglazed window.
Again I shouted; but there was no answer:
the place was desolate and deserted. I
afterwards learned that this house had
been built for the residence of the chief of
the Konza tribe, but that the ground upon
which it was situated, having been discovered
to be within a tract, granted to
some other tribe, the chief had deserted it,
and it had been allowed to fall to ruin.</p>

<p>My guide waited patiently until I
finished my examination, and then again
we pressed forward. Several times I was
deceived by the howling of wolves, which
I mistook for the baying of house-dogs; and
when I was passing through some dark
skirt of timber, and expected to come
upon a human habitation, I would be disappointed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
by seeing my guide once more
launch out into the open prairie. Several
times too, my hopes were excited by a
light, glimmering in the darkness, which
upon coming up, I would discover to proceed
from the trunk of a tree, which had
caught fire from the burning of the prairies.</p>

<p>Thus we kept on until near daylight,
when we emerged from a thick forest,
and came suddenly upon a small hamlet.
The barking of several dogs, who came
flying out to meet us, convinced me that
this time I was not mistaken. A light was
shining through the crevices of a log cabin;
I knocked at the door with a violence, that
might have awakened one of the seven
sleepers.</p>

<p>“Who dere—and vot de devil you
vant?” screamed a little cracked voice
from within.</p>

<p>It sounded like music to me. I stated
my troubles. The door was opened; a
head, garnished with a red night-cap, was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
thrust out, and after a little parley, I was
admitted into the bed-room of the man,
his Indian squaw, and a host of children.
As, however, it was the only room in the
house, it was also the kitchen. I had
gone so long without food, that notwithstanding
what I had eaten, the gnawings
of hunger were excessive, and I had no
sooner mentioned my wants, than a fire
was kindled, and in ten minutes a meal (I
don’t exactly know whether to call it
breakfast, dinner, or supper) of hot cakes,
venison, honey, and coffee, was placed before
me, and disappeared with the rapidity
of lightning. The squaw having seen me
fairly started, returned to her couch.
From the owner of the cabin, I learned
that I was now at the Konza Agency, and
that he was the blacksmith of the place.</p>

<p>About sunrise I was awakened from a
sound sleep, upon a bear-skin, by a violent
knocking at the door. It was my Indian
guide. He threw out broad hints<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
respecting the service he had rendered
me, and the presents he deserved. This
I could not deny; but I had nothing to
give. I soon found out, however, that
his wants were moderate, and that a small
present of powder would satisfy him; so I
filled his horn, and he left the cabin apparently
well pleased.</p>

<p>In a short time I left the house, and met
the Konza Agent, General Clark, a tall,
thin, soldier-like man, arrayed in an Indian
hunting shirt, and an old fox-skin cap.</p>

<p>He received me cordially, and I remained
with him all day, during which
time he talked upon metaphysics; discussed
politics, and fed me upon sweet potatoes.
In speaking of my guide, I found that
he had departed after receiving a large
present from the Agent, to whom he stated
that he had eaten nothing for twenty-four
hours. I spoke of the deer’s-flesh he had
left behind.</p>

<p>“The lying rascal!” said the General,
“he said he was starving.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span></p>

<p>I spoke of the Indian pony.</p>

<p>“What colour was he?” asked the General.</p>

<p>“Black; with short mane, and crop
ears.”</p>

<p>“My God! that’s my horse,” exclaimed
he, “stolen four days ago. What a
d——d villain that Konza is!”</p>

<p>At night the General furnished me with
a mule, and kindly accompanied me to the
garrison, which was forty miles distant,
and which we reached on the following
morning a little before daylight.</p>

<p>As I passed one of the out-houses in
riding up to the cantonment, I perceived
an Indian leaning against one of the door-posts.
“Ugh!” exclaimed he, starting
forward; and the next moment my hand
was grasped in the cordial, but iron gripe
of the Iotan chief.</p>

<p>The party had reached the garrison on
the evening previous; and the whole wild
band, both Pawnees and Otoes, were now
under the protection of the whites.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

</div>

<p class="small center mb2"><i>Assembling of Council.—Council.</i></p>

<p>Messengers had been sent in every
direction, to summon the neighbouring
tribes, to meet their ancient enemy, the
Pawnees, in council; and the day arrived
upon which these rival nations, who had
never before met except in deadly hostility,
were to mingle in peaceful ceremonial.</p>

<p>The different tribes had been for several
days collecting round the garrison, and
had pitched their wild camps in the adjacent
groves. There had always existed a
bitter hostility, between many of the civilized
and savage tribes. For this reason,
especial care had been taken, to keep them
separate, until by the influence of the
council, this cessation of hostilities, should
be converted into a permanent peace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span></p>

<p>Early in the morning, the loud report
of a piece of artillery bellowed through
the woods, echoing in the deep forest upon
the opposite side of the Missouri. This
was the signal for the assembling of the
council. In a few moments the warriors
of the different tribes, were seen leaving
their camps, and moving for the place appointed,
beneath several of the large trees,
in front of the quarters of the officers.</p>

<p>First came the Delawares, dressed for
the occasion, glittering with trinkets; their
silver ornaments glistening in the sunshine,
and their gay ribands fluttering in the
wind. They were a gaudy, effeminate-looking
race. Yet beneath all their frippery
of dress, lurked that indomitable
courage, and that thirst for glory, which
not even intemperance, and their intercourse
with the whites could destroy.
Behind the band, followed the proud Delaware
warrior Sou-wah-nock. It was he
that first kindled the torch of war, between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
his own tribe and the Pawnees, and led
the expedition that sacked the Pawnee
village. He was without ornament, except
a heavy silver plate, resting upon his
calico hunting-shirt. He was not tall, but
muscular, and his eye was as searching as
an eagle’s. There was a proud curl upon
his lip; and withal, an iron firmness
marked his whole deportment. He seemed
to think that the whole weight of
anger of the Pawnee nation, was about to
descend upon himself, but was ready to
meet it. He did not deny that he had
incited his nation to the outrage, upon the
Pawnee town. Nay, he gloried in it;
and was now ready to meet them in
friendship, or as enemies. He knew that
his nation looked up to him, and determined
that no act of his should ever sink
him in their opinion.</p>

<p>After the Delawares, followed the
Shawanese, headed by the same portly personage
who had greeted us when we entered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
as strangers, into the Indian country.
The same enormous pair of black spectacles
were seated astride of his nose, and
from his whole appearance, it is probable
that he had not undressed from the time
that we had last saw him, some four months
previous. At his heels followed the same
little potatoe-headed Indian, who had also
met us on the same occasion. Behind them,
came the gaudy warriors of the tribe,
reeking with paint, shining with tin ornaments,
and flaunting with ribands. These
seated themselves beside the Delawares.</p>

<p>Then followed the rest of the migrating
tribes; the Peorias, the Piankashaws, the
ragged Pottawattomies, and the lazy Kickapoos,
who all in turn seated themselves,
among their civilized brethren.</p>

<p>They had scarcely become stationary,
when the Otoes made their appearance.
They moved in Indian-file over the green,
headed by their sagacious old chief the
Iotan. They walked swiftly and silently,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
and ranged themselves at a little distance
from the more civilized, though less noble
band, which had already collected. A
few moments more, and the wild troop of
Pawnees were seen approaching. They
were muffled in their shaggy robes, and
marched forward with a heavy though
smothered tread. In front of them strode
the giant form of the Wild Horse; his
savage features not rendered any the less
hideous by a drunken frolic, in which he
had been engaged on the day previous.
His long hair hung tangled round his
head and shoulders. He wore no ornaments,
and his body as usual was smeared
with red ochre. The whole of his enormous
chest was bared, and exposed to the
cold chilling air of a frosty November
morning. Behind him followed the graceful,
though stern form of the Long Hair.
He walked to his allotted place, without
appearing to notice the congregated band
of civilized Indians. There were several<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
other chiefs in the train, and after them
followed the whole savage herd, from the
four Pawnee villages.</p>

<p>These stationed themselves directly opposite
the Delawares. Stern looks passed
between them, and burning feelings were
at work in their hearts. There they sat
brooding over past wrongs. Enemies from
the time that the Delawares had left the
eastern states, they were now assembled
to crush their bitter feelings, to put an
end to that dark hatred which had hitherto
existed between them, and to view each
other, in a strange and novel light—that
of friends. A total revulsion was to take
place in their feelings. Old habits, old
associations, were to be blotted out; deep-rooted
prejudices were to be removed, and
hands which before had clenched each
other, only in the death-grapple, were
now to be clasped in the warm pressure of
friendship.</p>

<p>Several days before the commencement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
of the meeting, a trifling incident was
near putting an end to the incipient peace.</p>

<p>The little tribe of Delawares, who muster
but a hundred and fifty warriors at
most, had always considered themselves
the source from whence sprang the numerous
and powerful tribes scattered throughout
the whole of North America. It is
probable that this opinion is founded upon
some tradition still current among them,
respecting the power and antiquity of
their forefathers. These, were the Lenni
Lenape, who, coming up from the south,
seated themselves upon the eastern shores,
and were afterwards known to the whites
by the name of Delawares. They are
among the oldest of the tribes of which
tradition speaks. The remnant of this
race, in pursuance of their fatherly dogma,
had now appropriated to themselves
the title of great grandfathers to the whole
Indian race. Among the host of their
descendants were numbered those most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
unfilial of all great grandchildren, the rebellious
Pawnees. Notwithstanding the
injunctions of obedience to parents, which
have been laid down in all quarters of the
globe, this nation had been unwilling to
submit to the fatherly corrections, bestowed
upon their tribe by their great ancestors.
Nor is it to be wondered at; for
they consisted, in quietly killing and scalping,
all who fell in their way, and helping
them forward in their journey towards
the bright hunting grounds—a theme upon
which an Indian is for ever harping, during
the whole period of his probation here.
In addition to the bitter feelings created
by these hostilities, the Pawnees looked
upon this little handful of warriors
with the most sovereign contempt. Like
many other undutiful children, they were
ashamed of their great grandparents, and
denied that they had ever sprung from
the “Delaware dogs,” or that a drop of
Delaware blood was mingled with that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
which coursed through their veins. They
concluded their expression of ill will, by
refusing to commence the council, if they
were to be looked upon as the descendants
of that race. The Delawares, on the other
hand, were equally obstinate. They insisted
on adopting the refractory Pawnees
as their great grandchildren, and that
the latter should acknowledge them as
their great grandparents.</p>

<p>For a short time the commissioner was
perplexed. But at length, privately assembling
the chiefs of the Pawnees, he
endeavoured to overcome their prejudices
by means of fair words, and finally succeeded
in satisfying their scrupulous pride.
He begged that for the sake of peace, the
Delawares should be humoured, although
he acknowledged to the Pawnees, that
he knew there was no ground for their
claim of relationship. At the same time,
he added, it was so absurd in itself that no
person would for a moment credit, that so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
brave and powerful a people as the Pawnees,
should have sprung from so paltry a
stock as the Delawares. The chiefs smiled
grimly as they received the pleasing unction
of flattery, and at length consented,
though with wry faces, to submit to the
degrading appellation until the council
should be ended, and the treaty ratified.
They then threw out sage hints, which if
translated literally, would amount nearly
to the same thing, as sending the Delawares
to the devil.</p>

<p>These preliminaries had been settled
before the day of council. The great
grandchildren, reversing the usual order
of things, no longer disowned their great
grandfathers; though farther than the
mere title, there was no display of kindly
feeling. The two bands sat opposite each
other, with the same grim expression of
countenances, that might have been expected
from so many wild cats. Each
seemed fearful to make a single friendly
step in advance, lest he should compromise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
the dignity of his tribe. After a
short time the commissioner rose up, and
stated the object of the meeting:—that
war had long enough, been raging among
them; and that the different tribes had
now assembled for the purpose of uniting
themselves in the bonds of friendship. He
then entered explicitly, into the conditions
of the intended peace.</p>

<p>When he had ended, different warriors
of each tribe addressed the council. They
all professed the greatest friendship for
their enemies, and poured out very penitential
speeches, bewailing their past transgressions,
and winding up, by throwing
the whole blame, upon the shoulders of
some neighbouring tribe.</p>

<p>For a short time the potentates of several
little nations, which had barely inhabitants
enough to hang a name upon, cased
their own importance by speaking. The
Delaware warrior Sou-wah-nock then rose.
He spoke of the destruction of the Grand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
Pawnee village. He did not deny his
agency in the deed. “The Pawnees,”
said he, “met my young men upon the
hunt, and slew them. I have had my
revenge. Let them look at their town.
I found it filled with lodges: I left it a
heap of ashes.” The whole of his speech
was of the same bold, unflinching character,
and was closed in true Indian style.
“I am satisfied,” said he, “I am not
afraid to avow the deeds that I have done,
for I am Sou-wah-nock, a Delaware warrior.”
When he had finished, he presented
a string of wampum to the Wild
Horse, as being the most distinguished
warrior of the Pawnee nation. When the
slight bustle of giving, and receiving the
present, had been finished, the chief of
the Republican village rose to answer his
warrior enemy.</p>

<p>His speech abounded with those wild
bursts of eloquence, which peculiarly mark
the savages of North America, and concluded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
in a manner, which spoke highly
of his opinion of what a warrior should be.
“I have promised to the Delawares,” said
he, “the friendship of my tribe. I respect
my promise, and I cannot lie, for I
am a Pawnee chief.”</p>

<p>When the Delawares had spoken, our
little fat friend from the Shawnee village
rose. After frequent expectorations, he
at length succeeded in clearing a passage
for the escape of his voice. He contrived
with great difficulty to wheeze through a
speech of about ten minutes in length.
There appeared to be but two ideas in the
whole of the address; and when he had
thoroughly belaboured one, he most assiduously
returned to the other. After
repeating them again and again, with the
addition of a new dress for each time, he
seated himself, perfectly convinced that
he had thrown a great deal of light upon
the subject.</p>

<p>There was a strange contrast between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
the deportment of the civilized, and savage
Indians. The first, from long intercourse
with the whites, had acquired many of
their habits. Their iron gravity had
yielded to a more mercurial temperament.
Even in the midst of the council they gave
free vent to their merriment, and uttered
their gibes and jests. They were constantly
on the move, coming and going to
and from the place of assembly, and paying
but little heed to the deliberations.</p>

<p>The Pawnees sat unmoved, listening in
silence and with profound attention, to
the addresses of those who spoke. They
rarely uttered a word, and the only smile
which curled their lips, was one of scorn at
the frivolous deportment of their enemies.</p>

<p>From early in the morning, till near
sunset, the council continued. They
then adjourned until the following day;
in order that a few little potentates, who
considered themselves the luminaries of
their respective villages, might receive
an opportunity to display their eloquence.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

</div>

<p class="small center mb2"><i>Pawnee Dance.—Delaware Visiters.</i></p>

<p>In the evening it was determined, to
bring the Delawares and the Pawnees together
as friends, for as yet they had held
no intercourse. A large fire was accordingly
built before the out-houses in which
the Pawnees had taken up their quarters,
and the wild troop sallied forth, prepared
to commence one of their national dances,
round the flame. A group of eight or ten
savage looking fellows, seated themselves
a little distance off, furnished with a drum
and rattle. They commenced a song, accompanied
by their rude instruments. For
a time there was no movement among the
Pawnees, who stood huddled in a large,
condensed crowd. Suddenly one of them,
a tall muscular savage, sprang into the
middle of the circle, and gazed around<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
with a hurried air, then with a loud yell
he commenced his dance. He jumped
slowly round the fire, with a kind of zig-zag
step: at every leap uttering a deep
guttural “Ugh!” occasionally accompanied
with a rattling sound, from the very
bottom of his lungs. His comrades looked
on silently, but with intense interest.
They were a savage group; face and body
begrimed with paint; their fierce features
reflecting the flame, their teeth bared, and
every brow knotted into a frown. Head
rose behind head, and gleaming eyes were
seen peering through the living mass, until
those farthest off were hid by the darkness.</p>

<p>When the first warrior had made two
or three circles about the fire, a second
left the crowd and sprang forward in the
dance; a third followed, and a fourth,
until about twenty were flitting swiftly
round, and joining in the song. Occasionally
they stopped short in their course,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
and uttered a loud shrill yell, which was
taken up by the whole surrounding horde,
until the very trees echoed to the sound.
At one moment they moved swiftly forward,
and at another their steps were slow
and wearied. As we watched their fierce,
earnest faces, the forms of some wrapped
in shaggy robes, the painted bodies of
others, writhing in the dance, and then
turned to the silent, and equally savage
group of lookers on, it required no great
stretch of the imagination, to fancy them
a host of evil spirits, busied in fiendish
revel.</p>

<p>While they were thus engaged, the
crowd separated and revealed a Delaware
watching their movements. Behind
him were about twenty more of the same
tribe. No sooner had the Pawnees caught
sight of them, than they retired. Old
prejudices could not be rooted out at once,
and though the dancers remained at their
employment, the rest of the tribe drew off<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
in a sullen and haughty group, and stood
watching the countenances of their <i>quondam</i>
enemies.</p>

<p>This continued during the whole evening.
As it grew late, group after group
of the Pawnees left the fire, and retired
into their dwelling. The Delawares soon
followed their example, and although their
visit had continued for several hours, I
fear it did but little towards removing
that ancient venom, which, in spite of
their apparent friendship, was rankling in
their hearts.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

</div>

<p class="small center mb2"><i>Konza Council.—White Plume.—Tappage
Chief.—Treaty.—Interpreter.—Departure.</i></p>

<p>On the following morning, the loud
report of a piece of artillery announced
the hour of council. Once more the different
tribes left their respective encampments,
and assembled at the place of meeting.
Scarcely, however, had they collected,
before a long train of warriors
were seen stringing over the distant prairie—making
for the cantonment. They
approached swiftly until they reached
the quarters of the officers. They were
clothed in white blankets; each man carried
a rifle. They were a band from the
Konza nation, come to attend the council,
and settle the terms of peace. In front of
the troop was the White Plume, enveloped
in a large drab-coloured over coat.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
This piece of dress deprived him altogether
of that dignity of appearance which
had marked him upon our first meeting.
He now bore a strong resemblance in
form and gracefulness, to a walking hogs-head.
However, he seemed perfectly
satisfied with his attire: and in truth, I
believe there was scarcely a Pawnee who
did not envy him the possession of this
cumbersome article of apparel.</p>

<p>The appearance of this chief, and of a
delegation from his tribe, had been anxiously
expected. They were more venomous
in their hate against the Pawnees,
than any other of the neighbouring Indians,
and their hostility had been marked
by deeds of a more bloody character. The
Pawnees sat in silence, but with looks of
smothered ferocity, as they saw them approach.
However, they evinced no hostile
feelings, other than those conveyed by
their glances.</p>

<p>After a short conference with their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
agent, the Konzas withdrew from the
green, and encamped in the prairie, at a
few hundred yards’ distance. The council
then proceeded. The different chiefs and
warriors of the small tribes of the vicinity,
addressed the Pawnees—all agreeing to
bury their hostility, and regard them as
friends. These offers were most thankfully
received by the Pawnees, though
one of them afterwards remarked to the
interpreter, “that they had now made
peace with several nations with whom
they had never been at war, and of whom
they had never heard, until they rose to
address them in council.” This was little
to be wondered at; as many of them were
most pitifully represented; and two or
three little, pursy, short-winded fellows,
dressed in dirty calico, and bedraggled
ribands, composed the whole of their delegation,
and probably the whole of their
tribe.</p>

<p>The deliberations lasted during the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
whole day: for as these Indians had no
particular injuries to dwell upon, they
confined themselves to things in general;
and as this was a subject that would bear
to be expatiated upon, every man continued
his address until he had exhausted
his wind. The Pawnees listened with
exemplary patience; though I doubt if
there was one who regretted when the
last speaker had finished.</p>

<p>The morning following, the Pawnees
and Konzas had a meeting to settle their
difficulties. A large chamber in the garrison
had been selected for the purpose.
About ten o’clock in the forenoon they
assembled. The two bands seated themselves
upon long wooden benches, on opposites
sides of the room. There was a
strong contrast between them. The Konzas
had a proud, noble air, and their
white blankets as they hung in loose and
graceful folds around them, had the effect
of classic drapery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span></p>

<p>The Pawnees had no pride of dress.
They were wrapped in shaggy robes, and
sat in silence—wild and uncouth in their
appearance, with scowling brows, and
close pressed mouths.</p>

<p>At length the speaking commenced.
First rose the White Plume. He had
boasted to his tribe, that he would relate
such things, in his speech, as should cause
the Pawnees to wince. With true Indian
cunning, at first, in order that he might
conciliate the favourable opinion of those
present, he spoke in praise of the whites—expressing
his high opinion of them.
After this, he gradually edged off, into a
philippic against the Pawnee nation, representing
them as a mean and miserly
race—perfidious, and revengeful. There
was a hushed silence among his own people
as he spoke, and every eye was fastened
upon the grim group opposite. The
White Plume went on; and still the deepest
silence reigned through the room: that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
of the Konzas arose from apprehension: the
silence of the Pawnees was the hushed
brooding of fury.</p>

<p>The chief of the Tappage village was
sitting directly opposite the speaker; his
eye was dark as midnight: his teeth were
bared, and both hands were tightly grasped
round his own throat; but he remained
silent until the speech had finished.
When the White Plume had taken his
seat, half a dozen Pawnees sprang to their
feet; but the Tappage chief waved them
down: three times did he essay to speak,
and as often, did he fail. He rubbed his
hand across his throat, to keep down his anger;
then stepping out, and fixing his eye
on that of the Konza chief—in the calm,
quiet voice of smothered rage, he commenced
his answer: he proceeded; he
grew more and more excited—indulging
a vein of biting irony. The White
Plume quailed, and his eye drooped, beneath
the searching, scornful glance of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
wild enemy. Still the Pawnee went on:
he represented the injury which first kindled
the war between the two nations.
“My young men,” said he, “visited the
Konzas as friends: the Konzas treated
them as enemies. They were strangers in
the Konza tribe, and the Konzas fell upon
them, and slew them—and concealed their
death.” He then entered into the particulars
of the quarrel, which unfortunately
for the Konzas, were strongly against
them. The chief of the latter tribe, received
the answer with great philosophy;
nor did he attempt to utter any thing in
reply. Perhaps, too, he did not wish to
invite a second attack, from so rough a
quarter. When the Pawnee had finished,
the commissioner interposed, and after a
short time, harmony was restored, and
several of the inferior chiefs made their
harangues. They were of a more calm
and conciliating nature, and gradually
tended to soothe the inflamed feelings of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
their foes. The council lasted until sunset,
when the terms of the treaty were
finally adjusted.</p>

<p>On this occasion I was made sensible of
the justice of the complaint generally
made, by those who have had public negotiations
with the savage tribes, of the insufficiency
of the interpreters through whom
they are obliged to receive the sentiments
and language of the Indians. They are
with few exceptions, ignorant and illiterate.
Those we employed, spoke a wretched
French patois, and a still more wretched
English. On such, even the high imaginative
vein, the poetical thought, which run
through Indian eloquence, is entirely lost.
There was not a savage who addressed us,
who did not at times, clothe his ideas in
beautiful attire, and make use of wild and
striking similes, drawn from the stores of
his only instructress, nature. This we ascertained
from some persons present of cultivated
minds, and who were well versed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
in the Indian tongues. As to the interpreters,
they reduced every thing to a
bald, disjointed jargon.</p>

<p>On the day following the council, the
articles of peace were signed, and most of
the tribes departed for their respective
homes. A few of the Pawnees and Otoes
remained to accompany the Commissioner
to the village of the Osages, for the purpose
of negotiating a peace with that tribe;
with whom they had long been at deadly
enmity.</p>

<p>Here then I will conclude this series of
Indian Sketches; for the council being
ended and my curiosity satisfied, I determined
to return homeward on the following
day. A feeling of sadness came over
me as I prepared to leave those, with
whom I had for months associated. However
different in dispositions and feelings,
we had until then, been united by a link
of sympathy. We had led the same life;
viewed the same scenes, and undergone<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
the same privations. For months together
one tent had sheltered us, and we had eaten
from the same board. A rough, untramelled
friendship had sprung up between
us, increasing with the distance
between ourselves and our homes, and
strengthening as we retired farther from
the abode of civilized man.</p>

<p>But now we had returned from our
wanderings, and were once more in the
circle of our fellows. Still old recollections
bound us together by a golden tie,
that was painful to sever; and although
my home with all its attractions rose in my
fancy, yet I felt sad, when one of the orderlies
informed me that all was ready.</p>

<p>I shook hands with my friends and comrades
of the wilderness, and mounting my
mule, with a heavy heart, turned my back
upon Leavenworth.</p>
